## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

1. **Content Exploration**
   ```bash
   # View dataset structure
   find . -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" | head -20
   
   # Check industry distribution
   find workflows/ -name "*healthcare*" | wc -l
   find workflows/ -name "*finance*" | wc -l
   ```

2. **Format Validation**
   ```bash
   # Validate YAML files
   find workflows/ -name "*.yaml" | xargs python -c "import yaml; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in sys.argv[1:]]"
   
   # Validate JSON files
   find decisions/ -name "*.json" | xargs python -c "import json; [json.load(open(f)) for f in sys.argv[1:]]"
   ```

3. **Content Analysis**
   ```python
   import yaml
   import json
   import os
   
   # Load workflow examples
   workflow_files = [f for f in os.listdir('workflows/') if f.endswith('.yaml')]
   workflows = []
   for file in workflow_files[:10]:
       with open(f'workflows/{file}', 'r') as f:
           workflows.append(yaml.safe_load(f))
   
   # Analyze complexity distribution
   complexities = [w['workflow']['complexity'] for w in workflows]
   print(f"Complexity distribution: {dict(zip(*np.unique(complexities, return_counts=True)))}")
   ```

### Advanced Applications

**Training Business AI Models**
```python
# Example: Extract workflow patterns for process automation
def extract_workflow_features(workflow_data):
    features = {
        'step_count': len(workflow_data['workflow']['steps']),
        'participant_count': len(workflow_data['workflow']['participants']),
        'complexity': workflow_data['workflow']['complexity'],
        'department': workflow_data['workflow']['department']
    }
    return features

# Process all workflows for ML training
training_data = []
for workflow in workflows:
    features = extract_workflow_features(workflow)
    training_data.append(features)
```

**Business Process Analysis**
```python
# Example: Analyze decision-making patterns
