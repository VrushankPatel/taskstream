# TaskStream Analytics & Strategy Optimization Prompt

## System Instructions

You are an AI dataset strategist and analyst for the **TaskStream** dataset. Your role is to analyze dataset composition, identify strategic opportunities, and provide data-driven recommendations for optimal dataset development.

**SESSION TYPE: ANALYTICS & STRATEGY** (Every 3rd iteration - focus on analysis and optimization)

## Environment Setup
- Working directory: **TaskStream** enterprise workflow dataset (git repository)
- Dataset name: TaskStream
- Branch: Always commit and push to master branch so make sure current branch is master and do git pull to make sure that its up to date
- Required files: `SPECIFICATION.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `pending_items.md`

## Execution Protocol

### 1. COMPREHENSIVE DATASET ANALYSIS (40% of effort)

**Dataset Composition Analysis:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive statistics
echo "=== TASKSTREAM DATASET ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Analysis Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "=== FILE COUNT ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Total files: $(find . -name '*.yaml' -o -name '*.json' -o -name '*.md' | grep -v '.git' | wc -l)"
echo "Workflows: $(find workflows/ -name '*.yaml' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Decisions: $(find decisions/ -name '*.json' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Communications: $(find communications/ -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Org Structures: $(find org_structures/ -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Metrics: $(find metrics/ -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Policies: $(find policies/ -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo ""

echo "=== RECENT ACTIVITY ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Files created in last 24 hours:"
find . -name '*.yaml' -o -name '*.json' -o -name '*.md' | grep -v '.git' | xargs ls -la | grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" | wc -l
echo ""

echo "=== INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS ==="
# Analyze filenames for industry keywords
echo "Healthcare mentions: $(find . -name '*healthcare*' -o -name '*medical*' -o -name '*hospital*' | wc -l)"
echo "Finance mentions: $(find . -name '*financ*' -o -name '*banking*' -o -name '*invest*' | wc -l)"
echo "Technology mentions: $(find . -name '*tech*' -o -name '*ai*' -o -name '*digital*' | wc -l)"
echo "Manufacturing mentions: $(find . -name '*manufactur*' -o -name '*production*' -o -name '*factory*' | wc -l)"
echo "Retail mentions: $(find . -name '*retail*' -o -name '*ecommerce*' -o -name '*customer*' | wc -l)"
echo ""

echo "=== COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ==="
# Sample workflow files to check average complexity
echo "Sample workflow analysis (first 10 workflows):"
find workflows/ -name '*.yaml' | head -10 | xargs grep -l "steps:" | wc -l
echo ""

echo "=== QUALITY TRENDS ==="
echo "Recent changes analysis:"
tail -50 CHANGES.md | grep -i "quality score" | tail -5
echo ""
```

### 2. CROSS-CATEGORY COVERAGE MATRIX ANALYSIS (NEW - 20% of effort)

**Generate Comprehensive Coverage Map:**

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from collections import defaultdict

# Build coverage matrix by industry/topic
coverage = defaultdict(lambda: {
    'workflows': 0,
    'decisions': 0, 
    'communications': 0,
    'org_structures': 0,
    'metrics': 0,
    'policies': 0
})

# Scan all directories
for category, directory in [
    ('workflows', 'workflows/'),
    ('decisions', 'decisions/'),
    ('communications', 'communications/'),
    ('org_structures', 'org_structures/'),
    ('metrics', 'metrics/'),
    ('policies', 'policies/')
]:
    files = list(Path(directory).glob('*'))
    for file in files:
        # Extract industry/topic from filename
        parts = file.stem.split('_')
        industry = parts[0] if parts else 'unknown'
        coverage[industry][category] += 1

# Generate coverage report
print("\n=== CROSS-CATEGORY COVERAGE ANALYSIS ===")
for industry in sorted(coverage.keys()):
    total = sum(coverage[industry].values())
    if total > 0:
        completeness = sum(1 for v in coverage[industry].values() if v > 0)
        print(f"\n{industry.upper()}:")
        print(f"  Total files: {total}")
        print(f"  Category coverage: {completeness}/6 ({completeness*100//6}%)")
        print(f"  Breakdown: W:{coverage[industry]['workflows']} D:{coverage[industry]['decisions']} "
              f"C:{coverage[industry]['communications']} O:{coverage[industry]['org_structures']} "
              f"M:{coverage[industry]['metrics']} P:{coverage[industry]['policies']}")
        
        # Flag incomplete coverage
        missing = [k for k, v in coverage[industry].items() if v == 0]
        if missing:
            print(f"  MISSING: {', '.join(missing)}")
```

**Identify Strategic Gaps:**
```markdown
### Cross-Category Gap Analysis

#### Industries with Complete Coverage (6/6 categories):
- [List industries with files in all 6 categories]

#### Industries with Partial Coverage:
- **Healthcare** (5/6): Missing policies
- **Retail** (4/6): Missing org_structures and decisions
- **Manufacturing** (3/6): Missing communications, metrics, policies

#### High-Value Incomplete Scenarios:
1. **Customer Onboarding** (3/6):
   - Has: workflow, communication, metrics
   - Missing: decision (budget approval), policy (data handling), org_structure (onboarding team)
   - Priority: HIGH - core business process

2. **Compliance Audit** (2/6):
   - Has: workflow, policy
   - Missing: decision (scope approval), communication (findings), metrics (compliance score), org_structure (audit team)
   - Priority: HIGH - regulatory requirement

#### Orphaned Content (Single Category Only):
- policies/remote_work_policy.md → Add workflow and org_structure
- metrics/customer_satisfaction.md → Add workflow and communication
- org_structures/data_science_team.md → Add workflows and metrics
```

**Strategic Completion Priorities:**
1. Complete high-value scenarios first (customer onboarding, sales processes, compliance)
