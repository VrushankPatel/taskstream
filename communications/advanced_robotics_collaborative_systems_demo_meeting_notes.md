### Demo Overview
Vendor presented live demonstration of collaborative robot systems in manufacturing environment:
- Safe human-robot interaction protocols
- Force-limiting technology preventing injury
- Real-time speed adjustment based on proximity
- Emergency stop and recovery procedures

### Key Discussion Points

#### Safety Features Demonstrated
- Advanced sensors detecting human presence within 1 meter
- Automatic speed reduction from 2 m/s to 0.3 m/s when humans nearby
- Compliant materials preventing injury on contact
- Multi-zone safety monitoring with visual indicators

#### Production Benefits
- 40% increase in assembly line efficiency
- Reduced ergonomic strain on workers
- Improved product quality through consistent operations
- Flexible workstation reconfiguration

#### Implementation Concerns
- Initial training requirements for operators
- Workspace redesign for safety zones
- Integration with existing production systems
- Maintenance and calibration procedures

### Decisions Made
1. **Pilot Program Approval:** Approved 6-month pilot with 2 collaborative robots on Assembly Line 3
2. **Training Program:** Mandatory 16-hour training for all affected personnel
3. **Safety Protocol Development:** New protocols to be developed by Safety Committee within 30 days
4. **Timeline:** Pilot launch scheduled for November 1, 2025

### Action Items
- Engineering: Complete workstation safety assessment by October 15
- Safety Committee: Develop and approve new protocols by October 31
- HR: Schedule training sessions for 50 operators starting October 5
- Vendor: Provide detailed installation and maintenance manuals by October 10
- Production: Prepare Line 3 for system integration by October 25

### Risk Mitigation
