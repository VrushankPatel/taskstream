Michael,

CTO team is energized about this initiative. We'll have the vendor evaluation criteria finalized by Monday and shortlist ready for the September meeting.

One question: Should we include AI-driven optimization capabilities in the initial scope, or phase that in later?

Sarah,

Good question. Let's include core AI capabilities in the initial implementation but keep advanced optimization features as Phase 2. This gives us the foundation while managing scope.
