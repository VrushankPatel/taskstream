## Meeting Minutes

### Opening Remarks (14:00-14:15)

**Dr. Kevin Liu (Chair):** Welcome to our quarterly working group meeting. Today's primary focus is harmonizing commercial drone certification standards across ASEAN+3 to enable seamless cross-border operations for logistics, inspection, and emergency services.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Review progress on mutual recognition agreements
2. Discuss beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) certification standards
3. Address urban air mobility (UAM) certification framework
4. Plan 2025 implementation roadmap

---

### Progress Report: Mutual Recognition Framework (14:15-15:00)

**Sarah Tan (Singapore CAAS):** Significant progress on the ASEAN Drone Certification MOU. Five countries have completed legal reviews, three pending parliamentary approval.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia: MOU ratified
- ⚠️ Philippines, Indonesia: Parliamentary review ongoing
- 🔄 Japan, South Korea: Bilateral discussions progressing
- ❌ Australia: Still evaluating framework compatibility

**Hiroshi Tanaka (Japan JCAB):** Japan's position remains positive, but we need clarity on maintenance standards harmonization. Our domestic industry requires 500-hour inspection intervals, while ASEAN standard proposes 300 hours.

**Michael O'Brien (Australia CASA):** Australia supports the framework concept but needs assurance that safety standards won't be compromised. We propose a risk-based approach with category-specific requirements.

**DECISIONS MADE:**
1. Technical working group to reconcile maintenance interval differences by December 2024
2. Risk categorization matrix to be developed by Singapore CAAS
3. Pilot program for mutual recognition to begin Q2 2025 with 3 countries

### BVLOS Certification Standards Discussion (15:00-15:45)

**Dr. Park Min-ho (South Korea MOLIT):** South Korea has certified 15 BVLOS operations this year, primarily for infrastructure inspection and agricultural monitoring. Key success factors: robust detect-and-avoid systems, reliable command and control links, comprehensive risk assessment.

**Technical Requirements Consensus:**
- Detect and avoid systems: Minimum 2km detection range
- Command and control: Redundant communication links required
- Emergency procedures: Automated return-to-home capability
- Pilot training: Minimum 100 hours BVLOS simulation
- Insurance: $5M liability coverage minimum

**Zhang Wei (DJI Enterprise):** Industry perspective - current requirements vary significantly across countries. For example, Singapore requires certified ground control stations, while Thailand accepts mobile applications. Harmonization would reduce compliance costs by 40%.

**Ahmad Rahman (Malaysia DCA):** Malaysia proposes establishing regional testing centers. We have facilities in Subang that could serve multiple countries, reducing certification timelines from 6 months to 3 months.

**ACTION ITEMS:**
- Technical specifications document to be circulated by November 30
- Regional testing center proposal to be evaluated
- Pilot training standards to be harmonized by Q1 2025

### Urban Air Mobility Framework (15:45-16:30)

**Jennifer Walsh (Australia CASA):** Urban Air Mobility represents the next frontier. Australia is working with Sydney and Melbourne on vertiport certification. Key challenges: air traffic integration, noise regulations, passenger safety.

**Tomohiro Fukuzawa (SkyDrive):** From manufacturer perspective, we need clear certification pathways for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Current helicopter regulations don't adequately address our technology.

**Dr. Kevin Liu:** Singapore is developing a UAM sandbox approach - designated air corridors for testing, simplified certification for specific routes, phased introduction based on operational complexity.

**UAM Certification Framework Proposals:**
1. **Phase 1 (2025):** Cargo delivery in designated corridors
2. **Phase 2 (2026):** Passenger services on fixed routes
3. **Phase 3 (2027+):** On-demand urban air taxi services

**Carlos Santos (Philippines CAAP):** Philippines interested in UAM for island connectivity. We propose expanding framework to include inter-island passenger services, not just urban environments.

**DECISIONS:**
- UAM technical working group established with Singapore as lead
- Phased implementation approach approved in principle
- Inter-island connectivity added to scope

### Industry Challenges and Opportunities (16:30-16:50)

**Agnishwar Jayaprakash (Garuda Aerospace):** India's experience with drone regulations shows importance of digital platforms for certification tracking. We suggest regional digital certificate system enabling real-time verification.

**Current Industry Pain Points:**
- Regulatory uncertainty affecting investment decisions
- Lengthy certification processes (6-18 months average)
- Inconsistent pilot training requirements
- Insurance availability and costs
- Public acceptance and safety perception

**Toru Tokushige (Terra Drone):** Japanese market demonstrates value of industry-government partnership. Regular technical exchanges reduce misunderstandings and accelerate innovation.

**Robert Kim (Insitu Pacific):** Military and civilian certification overlap needs addressing. Many technologies developed for defense have civilian applications but face regulatory barriers.

**OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED:**
1. Regional digital certification platform
2. Industry-government technical exchanges
3. Dual-use technology certification pathways
4. Public awareness campaigns for safety

### 2025 Implementation Roadmap (16:50-17:00)

**Next Quarter Priorities (Q1 2025):**
1. **January:** Technical working group deliverables due
2. **February:** Industry consultation on draft standards
3. **March:** Pilot program country selection and planning

**Mid-year Milestones (Q2-Q3 2025):**
- Mutual recognition pilot program launch
- BVLOS harmonized standards implementation
- UAM corridor designation in 3 cities
- Regional digital platform prototype

**Year-end Goals:**
- 70% of commercial drone certifications mutually recognized
- BVLOS operations increased by 200% across region
- UAM regulatory framework finalized
- Industry satisfaction score >4.0/5.0
