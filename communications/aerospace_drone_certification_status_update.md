## Communication Thread: Drone Certification Status Update

**From:** Aerospace Certification Manager  
**To:** Executive Leadership, Operations Team, Regulatory Affairs  
**Subject:** BVLOS Drone Operations Certification - Phase 2 Update  

Team,

Following our recent FAA technical review meeting, I wanted to provide an update on our Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) certification progress.

**Current Status:**  
Phase 1 (Technical Review) completed successfully with only minor clarifications requested. Phase 2 (Operational Demonstration) is now underway with our first test flights scheduled for next month.

**Key Milestones:**  
- âœ… Technical documentation review: Complete  
- ðŸ”„ Operational safety demonstration: In progress (60% complete)  
- ðŸ“… Regulatory approval: Target Q1 2026  
- ðŸš€ Commercial operations: Target Q2 2026  

**Resource Requirements:**  
Additional flight test personnel needed for expanded testing schedule. Operations team should prepare for increased airspace coordination requirements.

**Risk Considerations:**  
- Weather delays could extend testing timeline by 4-6 weeks  
- Additional FAA requirements may increase certification costs by 15%  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Complete Phase 2 test flight protocols by end of month  
2. Schedule stakeholder briefing with FAA representatives  
3. Begin preparation for Phase 3 compliance documentation  

The team has done excellent work getting us to this point. Let's maintain our momentum through the operational testing phase.

Best regards,  
Aerospace Certification Manager

**Reply from Operations Director:**  
We'll coordinate additional test personnel. Should we prepare contingency plans for weather delays?
