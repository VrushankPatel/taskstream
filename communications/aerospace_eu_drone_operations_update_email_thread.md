**Subject:** EASA Drone Operations Regulation Update - Immediate Action Required

Team,

Following the recent EASA announcement on enhanced drone operations requirements, I need to provide an urgent update on our compliance status.

Key changes effective January 1, 2026:
- Mandatory geo-fencing for all operations
- Enhanced pilot certification requirements
- Real-time tracking and reporting systems
- Increased insurance coverage minimums

Our current compliance assessment shows we're 70% ready. The main gaps are in geo-fencing implementation and pilot recertification.

I've scheduled an emergency planning meeting for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM to develop our action plan.

Please review the attached EASA guidance document before the meeting.

Best regards,
Anna
Head of Regulatory Affairs

Thanks for the heads-up, Anna. This is critical for our operations.

Can you provide a detailed timeline for compliance and any potential operational impacts? We need to assess if this will affect our current contracts.

Also, what are the cost implications for the required upgrades?

Regards,
Michael
COO

Michael,

Timeline assessment:
- Phase 1 (Geo-fencing): Complete by November 30, 2025
- Phase 2 (Pilot training): Complete by December 31, 2025
- Phase 3 (Tracking systems): Complete by January 31, 2026

Operational impacts: Minimal disruption expected with phased implementation. One contract may require temporary suspension during upgrades.

Cost estimate: €2.5M total
- Geo-fencing systems: €1.2M
- Pilot training: €0.8M
- Tracking systems: €0.5M

I'll prepare a detailed cost-benefit analysis for Tuesday's meeting.

Best,
Anna

Anna, Michael,

From operations perspective, the geo-fencing requirement will actually improve our safety protocols. However, the pilot recertification will require careful scheduling to avoid service disruptions.

I recommend we start with a pilot program on our busiest routes to test the new systems.

Let me know if you need operational data for the cost analysis.

Thanks,
Sarah
Director of Flight Operations
