**Subject:** Updated EASA Safety Certification Requirements - Implementation Timeline

Team,

Following our recent audit preparation meeting, I wanted to provide an update on the new EASA safety certification requirements that will impact our unmanned aerial systems operations.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has released updated certification standards for UAS operations, effective June 1, 2025. These changes include enhanced risk assessment protocols, improved data recording requirements, and stricter pilot certification standards.

**Key Changes:**
1. Mandatory real-time data transmission for all commercial UAS operations
2. Enhanced geo-fencing requirements for urban operations
3. New pilot competency assessments every 12 months
4. Improved incident reporting protocols

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Phase 1 (April 1-30): System upgrades and pilot training
- Phase 2 (May 1-31): Testing and validation
- Phase 3 (June 1+): Full compliance operations

We have budgeted €2.3M for these upgrades, with expected completion by May 15th. The certification team has already begun vendor evaluations for the required software updates.

Please review the attached detailed implementation plan and let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,  
Dr. Elena Rodriguez  
Chief Safety Officer

Elena,

Thanks for the comprehensive update. The timeline looks aggressive but achievable. I have a few concerns about the pilot training requirements - our current certification process may need significant overhaul.

Can we schedule a follow-up meeting with the training department to discuss the competency assessment changes? Also, have we considered the impact on our delivery schedules during Phase 2 testing?

Marcus,

Good points. I've scheduled a training requirements review meeting for March 15th at 10:00 CET. We'll invite the training department leads to discuss the competency assessment framework.

Regarding delivery schedules, we've built in a 20% capacity buffer during Phase 2 to minimize impact. The testing will be conducted primarily during off-peak hours.

Let me know if you'd like to add any other topics to the agenda.

Best,  
Elena

Elena,

The €2.3M budget allocation has been approved. Can you provide a breakdown of the major cost components? Also, what contingency plans do we have if the certification process encounters delays?

Sofia,

Thank you for the budget approval. Here's the cost breakdown:

- Software upgrades: €1.1M
- Hardware modifications: €650K
- Training programs: €350K
- Consulting services: €200K

We have a 15% contingency budget and have identified alternative certification pathways if needed. Our vendor contracts include penalty clauses for delays, providing additional protection.

I'll send the detailed budget spreadsheet shortly.

Best regards,  
Elena
