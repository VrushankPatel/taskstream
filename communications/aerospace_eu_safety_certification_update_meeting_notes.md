## Meeting Notes: EU Aerospace Safety Certification Update

**Date:** 2025-05-10 10:00
**Location:** Brussels Office, Conference Room A
**Attendees:** Chief Safety Officer (Chair), Certification Manager, Engineering Director, Regulatory Affairs Director, EASA Liaison Officer
**Subject:** EASA New Safety Standards Implementation Progress

### Regulatory Context
- **New EASA Standards:** Effective January 2026, requiring enhanced safety protocols for unmanned systems
- **Compliance Deadline:** December 31, 2025
- **Impact Scope:** All drone operations, autonomous systems, and space traffic management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Phase 1 (System Assessment):** 85% complete
  - Safety management system audit completed
  - Risk assessment framework developed
  - Gap analysis finalized

- **Phase 2 (Technology Upgrades):** 60% complete
  - Autonomous collision avoidance systems: 70% deployed
  - Real-time monitoring platforms: 50% operational
  - Emergency response protocols: 80% documented

- **Phase 3 (Certification Process):** 30% complete
  - Documentation preparation: 40% complete
  - Testing protocols: 20% developed
  - EASA submission: Target Q4 2025

### Challenges Identified
1. **Technical Integration:** Legacy systems compatibility issues
2. **Resource Constraints:** Limited engineering bandwidth
3. **Regulatory Clarity:** EASA guidance still evolving
4. **Cost Overruns:** 15% above initial budget estimates

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Technical Solutions**
   - Prioritize critical system integrations
   - Extend vendor support contracts
   - Implement phased rollout approach

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Hire 5 additional certification specialists
   - Reallocate engineering resources from non-critical projects
   - Engage external consultants for documentation

3. **Regulatory Management**
   - Weekly meetings with EASA representatives
   - Join industry working groups for guidance
   - Monitor regulatory updates continuously

### Timeline Adjustments
- **Original Certification Date:** Q4 2025 → **Revised:** Q1 2026
- **Full Compliance:** Q2 2026 → **Revised:** Q3 2026
- **Budget Increase:** €2M additional approved

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Non-compliance penalties (€500K daily fines)
- **Medium Risk:** Operational disruptions during upgrades
- **Low Risk:** Technology integration challenges (mitigated by phased approach)

### Action Items & Owners
- **Certification Manager:** Complete Phase 2 upgrades by August 31
- **Engineering Director:** Resolve legacy system integration issues by June 30
- **Regulatory Affairs Director:** Schedule bi-weekly EASA meetings
- **Chief Safety Officer:** Present updated timeline to Board by May 20

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Certification Progress:** 30% → 100% by Q4 2025
- **System Reliability:** Maintain 99.5% uptime during upgrades
- **Compliance Cost:** Within 15% of revised budget
- **Audit Readiness:** Pass internal audits by September 30

### Meeting Adjourned
**Time:** 12:00
**Next Meeting:** June 5, 2025 (10:00) - Implementation Progress Review
