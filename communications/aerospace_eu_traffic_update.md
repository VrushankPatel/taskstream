## Email Thread: EU Space Traffic Management Update

**From:** European Space Operations Center Director
**To:** Aerospace CEOs, National Space Agencies, ESA Partners
**Subject:** Critical Update: EU Space Traffic Management Regulation Implementation

Dear Colleagues,

Following the recent EU Parliament vote on the Space Traffic Management Regulation, I wanted to provide an immediate update on implementation timelines and required actions.

**Key Changes:**
- Mandatory orbital debris tracking for all satellites above 500km
- Real-time collision avoidance reporting requirements
- New licensing fees for commercial space operations
- Enhanced liability frameworks for space operators

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Phase 1 (Compliance Assessment): Complete by Q2 2026
- Phase 2 (System Implementation): Complete by Q4 2026
- Phase 3 (Full Operations): Effective Q1 2027

**Required Actions:**
1. Submit compliance declarations by March 15, 2026
2. Implement tracking systems by September 30, 2026
3. Complete operator certification by December 31, 2026

We have scheduled a virtual briefing session for February 15th at 14:00 CET to discuss implementation details and answer questions.

Please confirm attendance and let us know if you need technical assistance with compliance.

Best regards,
Director European Space Operations Center

Thank you for the clear update. We appreciate the phased implementation approach.

**Questions:**
1. Will existing satellite constellations require retrofitting?
2. What are the estimated compliance costs for small operators?
3. Are there exemptions for research satellites?

We plan to attend the briefing and would like to present our implementation challenges.

Best regards,
CEO Commercial Space Operator

We support this important regulation for space safety. Our agency will provide technical assistance to smaller operators during implementation.

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Establish a centralized collision avoidance coordination center
- Develop standardized data exchange protocols
- Create a mutual assistance framework for emergency situations

We look forward to the briefing.

Best regards,
Director National Space Agency

Thank you for the feedback and support.

**Responses to Questions:**
1. Retrofitting will be required for satellites launched after 2020; grandfathering applies to older constellations with conditions
2. Estimated costs: €50K-€200K depending on constellation size; subsidies available for operators under €10M revenue
3. Research satellites have a 2-year exemption but must demonstrate safety protocols

**Additional Information:**
- Technical specifications will be published February 1st
- Pilot programs available for early adopters
- Compliance templates and checklists available on our portal

The briefing agenda has been updated to include a Q&A session and technical working groups.

Best regards,
Director European Space Operations Center
