   - Enhanced incident reporting protocols

### Critical Path Items
1. **Certification Timeline**
   - Safety case documentation: Complete by September 30
   - Independent safety assessment: October 15-20
   - EASA final review: November 1-15
   - Operational approval: December 1, 2024

2. **Resource Requirements**
   - Additional safety engineers: 3 FTEs needed
   - External audit consultants: €150K budget approved
   - Training facility upgrades: €200K in progress

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Parallel path for alternative certification approaches
   - Accelerated testing protocols for critical systems
   - Stakeholder communication plan for potential delays

### Technical Challenges
- **Autonomous Systems:** Integration testing with existing avionics
- **Cybersecurity:** Enhanced protection for flight control systems
- **Weather Resilience:** Operations in adverse EU weather conditions
- **Airspace Integration:** Coordination with ATC systems

### Financial Impact Assessment
- **Certification Costs:** €850K total (within budget)
- **Operational Delays:** Potential 6-week postponement if issues arise
- **Market Impact:** €50M revenue at risk from delayed commercial operations
- **Mitigation Budget:** €300K allocated for accelerated testing

### Action Items
1. **Certification Manager:** Complete safety case documentation by September 25
2. **Engineering Director:** Resolve autonomous system integration issues by October 5
3. **Regulatory Affairs Director:** Schedule EASA pre-audit meeting for September 10
4. **EASA Liaison Officer:** Update on regulatory changes by August 29
5. **Chief Safety Officer:** Present progress to Board on September 5

### Decision Points Identified
1. **Certification Approach:** Decision required on primary vs. alternative certification paths by September 1
2. **Resource Allocation:** Additional 3 FTE safety engineers - approval needed from HR by August 30
3. **Budget Reallocation:** €200K from contingency fund for accelerated testing - CFO approval required
4. **Timeline Adjustment:** Potential 4-week delay assessment - Board decision by September 15
5. **Vendor Selection:** External audit consultant selection - procurement process to start immediately

### Risk Register Updates
- **High Risk:** Autonomous system certification delays - Mitigation: Parallel development paths
- **Medium Risk:** Regulatory interpretation changes - Mitigation: Direct EASA consultation
- **Low Risk:** Resource constraints - Mitigation: Additional contractor support
