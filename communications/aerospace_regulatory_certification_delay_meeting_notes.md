# Meeting Notes: Aircraft Certification Delay Resolution

**Date:** September 22, 2025
**Time:** 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM
**Location:** Engineering Conference Room
**Attendees:**
- Certification Manager (Dr. Sarah Mitchell)
- Chief Engineer (Mark Johnson)
- Quality Assurance Director (Jennifer Lee)
- Regulatory Affairs Lead (Robert Chen)
- Program Manager (David Williams)
- FAA Liaison (External)

## Agenda
1. Current certification status
2. Root cause analysis of delays
3. Corrective action plan
4. Timeline recovery options

## Current Status
- **Program status:** 85% complete, 3 months behind schedule
- **Critical path:** Flight test completion delayed due to instrumentation issues
- **Budget impact:** $12M overrun, additional $8M projected
- **Customer impact:** Delivery delays affecting 50 aircraft orders

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issues Identified:**
1. **Instrumentation calibration errors:** Three separate incidents caused test invalidation
2. **Supplier quality issues:** Avionics components failed initial testing
3. **Regulatory interpretation differences:** FAA requirements more stringent than anticipated
4. **Resource constraints:** Key certification engineers reassigned to urgent programs

**Contributing Factors:**
- Inadequate risk assessment during planning phase
- Insufficient buffer time in critical path activities
- Limited supplier oversight during development

## Corrective Actions
**Immediate (Next 30 days):**
- Dedicated certification team formed (5 engineers)
- Daily standup meetings with FAA liaison
- Accelerated supplier quality audits
- Parallel testing protocols implemented

**Short-term (Next 90 days):**
- Additional instrumentation redundancy
- Enhanced supplier qualification process
- Regulatory interpretation alignment sessions
- Risk management framework updates

**Long-term (Next 6 months):**
- Certification process standardization
- Supplier performance monitoring system
- Resource capacity planning improvements

## Timeline Recovery Options
**Option A: Accelerated Testing**
- Additional test resources: $2M
- Recovery: 6 weeks
- Risk: Quality compromise potential

**Option B: Parallel Certification Paths**
- Supplemental type certificate approach
- Recovery: 8 weeks
- Risk: Regulatory approval uncertainty

**Option C: Phased Delivery**
- Deliver 70% capability first, complete certification later
- Recovery: 4 weeks initial delivery
- Risk: Customer satisfaction and contractual issues

**Recommended:** Option B with Option C as backup

## Decisions Made
1. Implement parallel certification approach
2. Allocate $3M additional budget for accelerated testing
3. Form dedicated tiger team reporting directly to CEO
4. Weekly executive updates on progress
5. Customer communication plan for delivery delays

## Action Items
- Sarah: Finalize accelerated test plan by September 29
- Mark: Coordinate with suppliers for expedited component delivery
- Jennifer: Implement enhanced quality control checkpoints
- Robert: Schedule weekly FAA alignment meetings
- David: Develop customer communication templates

## Next Meeting
September 29, 2025 - Progress review and test plan approval

**Meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM**
