**Subject:** Major Space Traffic Management Regulation Update

Leadership,

The International Space Traffic Coordination Agency has announced new regulations for commercial space operations effective January 2026. This significantly impacts our satellite deployment and orbital operations.

Key changes:

1. Mandatory collision avoidance systems for all satellites

2. Real-time orbital tracking requirements

3. Increased coordination windows for launches

4. Enhanced de-orbiting protocols

We need to accelerate our compliance program and may require additional investment in tracking technology.

Please advise on prioritization and resource allocation.

Best,

Dr. Sarah Chen
