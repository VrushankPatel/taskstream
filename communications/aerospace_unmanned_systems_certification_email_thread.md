## Email Thread: Aerospace Unmanned Systems Certification Update

**Subject:** FAA Certification Timeline Update - UAS Integration Project  

Team,

Following our recent meeting with FAA representatives, I wanted to provide an update on the unmanned aerial systems certification process for our new delivery drones.

Current status:
- Design review: Completed (Phase 1 approved)
- Safety analysis: 75% complete
- Flight testing: Scheduled to begin next month
- Final certification: Target Q1 2026

Key challenges identified:
- Additional redundancy requirements for autonomous flight systems
- Enhanced cybersecurity protocols needed
- Extended testing period due to urban environment complexity

This will push our commercial launch back by 3 months. Engineering team, please prioritize the safety enhancements.

Best,  
Robert Kim  
Certification Manager

Robert,

The engineering team has reviewed the FAA feedback. We can implement the redundancy requirements within 6 weeks, but the cybersecurity enhancements will require 8 weeks for proper testing.

Should we consider parallel certification in EU markets to accelerate global deployment?

Maria,

EU certification (EASA) would be beneficial but requires separate testing protocols. We could potentially leverage some FAA data for mutual recognition, saving 2-3 months.

However, this increases our regulatory budget by $500K. CEO approval needed for this approach.

James and team,

The EU opportunity makes sense given our international expansion plans. Please proceed with the dual certification strategy. The additional investment is justified by the market opportunity.

Keep me updated on progress.

Alex Thompson

Thank you, Alex. We'll initiate the EASA process immediately. Updated timeline:
- FAA certification: Q1 2026
- EASA certification: Q4 2025
- Global launch: Q2 2026
