**Subject:** Urgent: New FAA/EASA Unmanned Systems Certification Requirements  
**Date:** September 29, 2025

Team,

Following the recent joint FAA/EASA announcement on enhanced unmanned systems certification requirements, I've completed an initial impact assessment for our drone and autonomous aircraft portfolio.

**Key Changes:**
- Stricter cybersecurity standards for command and control systems
- Enhanced detect-and-avoid capabilities required
- New pilot certification requirements for BVLOS operations
- Implementation deadline: January 1, 2027

**Business Impact:**
- 40% of our current fleet requires system upgrades
- Estimated cost: $15M across 3 years
- Potential 6-month delay in new product launches
- Additional certification testing required

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Form cross-functional task force immediately
2. Conduct detailed compliance gap analysis
3. Develop upgrade roadmap with phased implementation
4. Engage with regulators for clarification on requirements

Please review the attached detailed assessment. I propose we schedule an emergency leadership meeting for Thursday to discuss resource allocation and timeline implications.

Best regards,  
Director of Aviation Safety

Thank you for the prompt analysis. This is indeed a critical regulatory change that affects our core business.

I concur with forming an immediate task force. Let's aim for the leadership meeting tomorrow at 10 AM. Please prepare:
- Executive summary of financial impact
- Risk assessment for delayed certifications
- Options for accelerated compliance

The board will need to be briefed next week.

The cybersecurity requirements are particularly challenging. Our current systems may require complete redesign for the enhanced encryption and authentication protocols.

Engineering teams are already modeling the technical requirements. Preliminary assessment suggests we can meet the 2027 deadline with focused development effort, but it will require prioritizing this over other initiatives.

I've reached out to our regulatory contacts at both FAA and EASA. They're offering technical clarification sessions next month. I recommend we participate to ensure our interpretation is correct.

This could actually present a competitive advantage if we achieve early compliance.
