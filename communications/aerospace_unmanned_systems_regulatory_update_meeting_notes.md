**Subject:** EASA Regulatory Update: Enhanced Safety Requirements for Unmanned Aerial Systems

### Meeting Purpose
Review of new European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and their impact on our drone operations and product development roadmap.

### Key Discussion Points

#### Regulatory Changes Overview
- **New Certification Requirements**: EASA implementing enhanced safety standards for UAS operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS)
- **Geofencing Mandates**: Mandatory geofencing systems for all commercial UAS operations in EU airspace
- **Pilot Training Standards**: Updated remote pilot certification requirements effective January 2025
- **Data Recording Requirements**: Mandatory flight data recording and transmission for all commercial operations

#### Business Impact Assessment
- **Product Development**: 6-month acceleration needed for geofencing technology integration
- **Operational Changes**: Updated pilot training programs required for all field teams
- **Cost Implications**: Estimated â‚¬2.5M investment in compliance systems and training
- **Market Opportunities**: Enhanced safety features could differentiate our products in EU market

#### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Q4 2024)**: Regulatory compliance assessment and gap analysis
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2025)**: Technology integration and pilot training program rollout
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2025)**: Full compliance certification and operational updates
