**Location:** Virtual Meeting Room A
**Attendees:** Sarah Chen (VP Agriculture Operations), Michael Rodriguez (Climate Scientist), Lisa Thompson (Farm Operations Manager), David Park (Sustainability Director), External Consultant: Dr. Elena Vasquez (Climate Adaptation Specialist)
**Facilitator:** Sarah Chen
**Note Taker:** Administrative Assistant

### Agenda Items

1. **Climate Impact Assessment Results** (15 min)
   - Presented by Dr. Elena Vasquez
   - Key findings: 15% yield reduction projected for drought-prone regions by 2030
   - Temperature increases averaging 2.1Â°C across major farming zones
   - Precipitation pattern shifts requiring irrigation system upgrades

2. **Current Adaptation Measures Review** (20 min)
   - Lisa Thompson presented existing drought-resistant crop varieties (adopted on 40% of acreage)
   - Water conservation systems implemented on 65% of operations
   - Soil health monitoring programs showing 12% improvement in organic matter content

3. **Technology Integration Opportunities** (25 min)
   - Michael Rodriguez demonstrated AI-powered weather prediction models
   - Precision irrigation systems with 30% water savings potential
   - Satellite-based soil moisture monitoring for real-time decision making

4. **Implementation Roadmap Discussion** (30 min)
   - Phase 1: Pilot advanced irrigation systems on 500 acres (Q1 2026)
   - Phase 2: Expand drought-resistant crop adoption to 80% of acreage (Q3 2026)
   - Phase 3: Implement AI weather integration across all operations (Q2 2027)

### Key Decisions Made

- **Budget Allocation**: Approved $2.8M for Phase 1 implementation
- **Pilot Selection**: Chose Midwest drought-prone region for initial rollout
