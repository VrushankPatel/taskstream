## Email Thread: Agriculture Climate Disruption Response

**From:** Operations Director, AgriCorp
**To:** Supply Chain Team, Executive Leadership
**Subject:** Urgent: Climate Event Impact on Q3 Harvest - Response Plan Required

Team,

Following the severe drought conditions affecting our Midwest farming partners, we're facing a 30% reduction in expected corn and soybean yields. This will impact our supply chain for the next 6 months.

Key impacts:
- 15,000 tons corn shortfall
- 8,000 tons soybean reduction
- Potential price increases of 25-35%

We need to activate our contingency plan immediately. Please prepare:
1. Alternative supplier assessment
2. Inventory reallocation strategy
3. Customer communication plan
4. Cost mitigation measures

Meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 9 AM to discuss.

Best,
Sarah Johnson
Operations Director

Sarah,

I've reviewed our backup suppliers in the South. They can provide 40% of the shortfall but at 15% premium pricing. Also checking international options, but logistics will be challenging.

Current inventory levels:
- Corn: 12,000 tons (sufficient for 45 days)
- Soybean: 6,000 tons (sufficient for 30 days)

Recommend immediate purchase of futures contracts to hedge pricing risk.

This is a critical situation that requires swift action. Sarah and Mike, please ensure our response minimizes customer impact. We may need to consider temporary price adjustments to maintain market share.

I'll join the 9 AM meeting. Let's have a comprehensive plan ready.

David,

Our key customers have been informed of potential delays. Most are understanding given the circumstances, but we should prepare communication about any price adjustments.

Also, this might be an opportunity to highlight our sustainable farming initiatives to differentiate us in the market.
