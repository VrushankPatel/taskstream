## Meeting Notes: Agriculture Crop Yield Optimization Strategy Session

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Attendees:** Operations Director, Farm Managers (3), Agronomist, Technology Specialist, Finance Manager
**Location:** Conference Room A

### Agenda
1. Review current yield performance
2. Evaluate precision agriculture technologies
3. Discuss irrigation optimization
4. Budget allocation for improvements

### Current Yield Performance Review
- **Corn yields**: 185 bu/acre (industry average: 178 bu/acre)
- **Soybean yields**: 62 bu/acre (industry average: 58 bu/acre)
- **Wheat yields**: 75 bu/acre (below industry average of 82 bu/acre)
- **Key challenges**: Variable weather patterns, soil nutrient depletion, pest pressure

**Action Items:**
- Implement soil sampling program for nutrient mapping
- Upgrade weather monitoring stations

### Precision Agriculture Technology Evaluation
**Proposed Technologies:**
- Variable rate fertilization systems ($150K)
- Drone-based crop scouting ($75K)
- AI-powered irrigation controllers ($200K)

**Benefits:**
- 10-15% yield improvement potential
- 20% reduction in input costs
- Real-time decision making capabilities

**Decision:** Approve pilot program for 500 acres with full evaluation in 6 months

### Irrigation Optimization Discussion
**Current System:** Center pivot irrigation with manual scheduling
**Proposed Improvements:**
- Soil moisture sensors integration
- Weather-based scheduling algorithms
- Variable speed drives for efficiency

**Expected ROI:** 25% water savings, 8% yield increase

**Action Items:**
- Install sensors on 20% of acreage by spring planting
- Train operators on new scheduling software

### Budget Allocation
**Total Requested:** $425K
**Approved Amount:** $350K (82% of request)
**Funding Sources:**
- Operations budget: $200K
- Technology modernization fund: $150K

**Phased Implementation:**
- Q1 2026: Sensor installation and basic automation ($150K)
- Q2 2026: Advanced analytics and AI integration ($200K)

### Risk Mitigation
- Weather contingency plans developed
- Supplier backup arrangements confirmed
- Staff training program outlined

### Next Steps
- Technology vendor selection by November 1
- Pilot area designation by November 15
- Implementation kickoff meeting December 1

**Meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM**
