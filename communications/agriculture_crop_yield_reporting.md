   - Region 2: 18% improvement in soybean yields through integrated pest management
   - Challenges: Late-season drought affected 20% of acreage in southern fields

3. **Quality Metrics Discussion**
   Sarah reviewed quality testing results:
   - Protein content up 3% in wheat crops
   - Mycotoxin levels below industry standards
   - Organic certification maintained across 85% of production
