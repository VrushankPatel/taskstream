   - Safe mixing and application
   - Environmental protection measures

3. **Worker Safety & Emergency Response** (April 1-8)

This is excellent timing. Our team has several new hires who will benefit greatly from the equipment training. However, we're concerned about coverage during peak planting preparation.

**Questions:**
- Can we stagger attendance to maintain field operations?
- Are there make-up sessions for those who miss due to weather?
- Will training count toward overtime hours?

Strong support for the equipment safety module. We've updated several tractors with new safety features that require specific training.

**Suggestions:**
- Include hands-on sessions with actual equipment
- Add module on drone operation for field monitoring
- Consider certification renewal requirements annually
