# AI Diagnostics Implementation Kickoff Meeting Notes

**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM  
**Location:** Conference Room A  
**Attendees:** Dr. Sarah Chen (Chief of Radiology), Dr. Michael Torres (AI Ethics Lead), Lisa Wong (IT Director), James Park (Data Privacy Officer), Dr. Emily Rodriguez (Staff Radiologist)

## Agenda
1. Project overview and objectives
2. Technical architecture review
3. Ethical and privacy considerations
4. Implementation timeline
5. Risk assessment and mitigation

## Discussion Summary

### Project Overview
Dr. Chen opened the meeting by outlining the hospital's commitment to integrating AI-assisted diagnostics to improve patient outcomes while maintaining physician oversight. The system will analyze chest X-rays for pneumonia detection with 94% accuracy based on initial validation studies.

### Technical Architecture
Lisa Wong presented the proposed architecture:
- AI model trained on 50,000 anonymized images
- Real-time analysis with physician review workflow
- Integration with existing PACS system
- Cloud-based processing to reduce local infrastructure load

**Key Decision:** Approved hybrid deployment model combining on-premises processing for sensitive cases with cloud backup.

### Ethical and Privacy Considerations
Dr. Torres raised concerns about algorithmic bias and transparency:
- Need for diverse training datasets
- Explainability requirements for physician trust
- Patient consent for AI-assisted diagnosis

James Park emphasized HIPAA compliance requirements:
- All patient data remains on secure hospital servers
- AI processing occurs in HIPAA-compliant cloud environment
- Audit logging for all AI recommendations

**Action Item:** Dr. Torres to draft AI ethics review protocol by October 5th.

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Infrastructure setup and model validation
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Parallel reading study with 20 radiologists
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Pilot deployment in emergency department
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Full rollout with training and monitoring

**Milestone:** Go-live target of December 15, 2025.

### Risk Assessment
Identified key risks:
1. Physician resistance to AI recommendations
2. Potential for over-reliance on AI
3. Data security vulnerabilities
4. Regulatory changes in AI medical devices

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive training program for all radiology staff
- Mandatory physician override capability
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- FDA regulatory monitoring

## Action Items
1. **Dr. Chen:** Schedule follow-up meeting with full radiology department (Due: October 3)
2. **Lisa Wong:** Finalize technical specifications document (Due: October 7)
3. **Dr. Torres:** Develop AI ethics framework (Due: October 5)
4. **James Park:** Conduct privacy impact assessment (Due: October 10)
5. **Dr. Rodriguez:** Lead physician training curriculum development (Due: October 15)

## Next Meeting
October 12, 2025 - Progress review and pilot planning

**Meeting Adjourned:** 3:30 PM
