**Subject:** New Algorithmic Transparency Policy - Building Trust Through Explainable AI  

**Date:** September 28, 2025  

Dear Colleagues,

I'm pleased to announce the implementation of our comprehensive Algorithmic Transparency Policy, a critical component of our responsible AI framework. This policy establishes clear requirements for explainable and transparent AI systems across all our products and services.

### Policy Overview

The Algorithmic Transparency Policy requires that all AI systems must:

1. **Provide Explainable Decisions** - Users can understand how AI systems arrive at their conclusions
2. **Document Training Data** - Clear documentation of data sources, quality, and potential biases
3. **Maintain Audit Trails** - Complete records of model development, testing, and deployment
4. **Enable Human Oversight** - Mechanisms for human review and intervention in critical decisions
5. **Communicate Limitations** - Clear disclosure of AI system capabilities and constraints

### Implementation Requirements

**For AI Development Teams:**
- Implement explainability frameworks in all new AI projects
- Document model decisions for high-risk applications
- Conduct regular transparency audits

**For Product Teams:**
- Include transparency features in user interfaces
- Develop clear communication about AI usage
- Establish user feedback mechanisms

**For All Employees:**
- Complete transparency training within 60 days
- Report concerns about non-transparent AI systems
- Support organizational transparency commitments

### Business Rationale

This policy addresses:
- Growing regulatory requirements for AI transparency
- Customer demands for understandable AI decisions
- Industry best practices for responsible AI
- Risk mitigation for AI-related incidents

### Timeline and Support

- **Immediate:** Policy takes effect for all new AI projects
- **30 days:** Training program launches for all employees
- **90 days:** Existing AI systems assessed for compliance
- **6 months:** Full transparency implementation across portfolio

We have established a Transparency Center of Excellence to support implementation, including:
- Technical guidance for explainability tools
- Training resources and workshops
- Audit and compliance support
- External transparency reporting framework

The technical implementation looks feasible with our current AI infrastructure. We've identified several explainability tools that can be integrated with minimal disruption. The audit trail requirements align well with our existing MLOps practices.

One consideration: The transparency features may impact model performance in some cases. We'll need to balance explainability with accuracy in our implementation guidelines.

From a product perspective, this policy creates opportunities to enhance user experience and build competitive advantages. Customers increasingly expect transparency in AI-powered features.

We'll need to collaborate closely on:
