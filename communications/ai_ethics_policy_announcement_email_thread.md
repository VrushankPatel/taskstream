**Date:** September 20, 2025

Dear Team,

I'm pleased to announce the rollout of our comprehensive AI Ethics Policy, developed over the past six months with input from cross-functional stakeholders including legal, data science, and business leaders.

**Key Policy Highlights:**
- **Bias Mitigation:** All AI models must undergo bias assessment before deployment
- **Transparency Requirements:** Decision-making processes must be explainable to stakeholders
- **Accountability Framework:** Clear ownership and review processes for AI systems
- **Privacy Protection:** Enhanced data governance for AI training and inference

The policy will be mandatory for all AI projects starting October 1. Training sessions are scheduled throughout October, and the full policy document is available in the company intranet.

Please review the attached policy document and attend the training sessions relevant to your role.

Best regards,
Dr. Sarah Chen
Chief Ethics Officer

Sarah,

This is excellent work. The bias mitigation framework aligns well with our current practices. One question - does this apply to our existing production models, or only new developments?

Thanks,
Mark Johnson

Mark,

Great question. The policy applies to all AI systems, including existing production models. We have a 6-month grace period for retroactive compliance, but we encourage immediate assessment of high-risk models.

We'll discuss implementation details in the training sessions.

Best,
Sarah
