Team,

NHTSA has confirmed our investigation of the brake software issue. We're initiating a voluntary recall of 150,000 vehicles.

Key elements:
- Affected models: 2022-2024 sedan line
- Safety risk: Software glitch causing intermittent brake delay
- Fix: Over-the-air software update
- Timeline: Notifications start next week

I've prepared communication materials emphasizing safety and our commitment to quality.

Legal review needed before public announcement.

Best,  
Thomas Wright  
Product Safety Director
