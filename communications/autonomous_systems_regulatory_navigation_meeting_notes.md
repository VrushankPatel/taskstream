**Meeting Date:** September 28, 2025
**Attendees:** Chief Legal Officer, Regulatory Affairs Director, Safety Director, Autonomous Systems Program Manager, External Legal Counsel
**Location:** Legal Department Conference Room

### Agenda
1. Current regulatory landscape assessment
2. State-by-state deployment strategy
3. Insurance and liability framework
4. Timeline and resource requirements

### Discussion Summary

**Regulatory Landscape**
The Regulatory Affairs Director presented a comprehensive overview of autonomous vehicle regulations across key markets:
- **Federal Level:** NHTSA guidelines provide framework but limited enforcement authority
- **State Level:** Varied approaches from full bans (e.g., Hawaii) to unrestricted deployment (e.g., California)
- **International:** EU AI Act and UN regulations create additional compliance layers

**Deployment Strategy**
The team agreed on a phased geographic expansion:
- **Phase 1 (2026):** Limited deployment in 5 permissive states with established AV corridors
- **Phase 2 (2027):** Expansion to 15 additional states with conditional permits
- **Phase 3 (2028):** National deployment contingent on federal framework

**Key Challenges Identified:**
- Inconsistent state-level requirements
- Rapidly evolving federal regulations
- Public acceptance and political pressures
- Insurance industry adaptation

**Insurance Framework**
External Legal Counsel presented options for liability coverage:
- Traditional auto insurance models insufficient for AV fleets
- Emerging specialized AV insurance products
- Self-insurance considerations for large fleets
- Regulatory requirements for minimum coverage levels

**Resource Requirements**
Program Manager outlined needs:
- Dedicated regulatory affairs team (8 FTEs)
- Legal budget increase of $2M annually
- State-level lobbying and advocacy programs
- Public relations campaign for acceptance

**Action Items**
1. Develop detailed state-by-state regulatory matrix (Regulatory Affairs, due Oct 15)
2. Engage insurance brokers for AV-specific coverage quotes (Safety Director, due Nov 1)
3. Prepare federal regulatory comment submissions (Legal Counsel, due Nov 30)
4. Launch public education campaign (Communications team, Q1 2026)

**Risk Mitigation**
- Establish regulatory monitoring dashboard
- Build relationships with key policymakers
- Maintain flexible deployment capabilities
- Prepare contingency plans for regulatory changes
