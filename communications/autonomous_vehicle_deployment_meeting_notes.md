## Meeting Notes: Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Deployment Strategy Review

**Date:** September 28, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
**Location:** Conference Room A
**Attendees:**
- Sarah Martinez, VP Product (Chair)
- Dr. Robert Chen, Chief Technology Officer
- Lisa Wong, Chief Legal Officer
- Mark Johnson, Head of Safety & Compliance
- Jennifer Kim, VP Operations
- External: Dr. Amanda Foster, Regulatory Consultant

**Objective:** Review autonomous vehicle deployment strategy and address key implementation challenges

### 1. Current Status Update (Sarah Martinez)
- Pilot program completed successfully in controlled environment
- 95% autonomous miles achieved with zero incidents
- Customer feedback overwhelmingly positive
- Regulatory approval pending for limited commercial deployment

### 2. Technical Readiness Assessment (Dr. Robert Chen)
- System reliability: 99.7% uptime in testing
- Sensor fusion performing well in diverse conditions
- AI models showing robust performance across edge cases
- Key challenge: Adverse weather conditions (heavy rain, fog)
- Mitigation: Enhanced sensor redundancy and conservative operating parameters

### 3. Regulatory and Safety Considerations (Mark Johnson, Dr. Amanda Foster)
- EU AI Act classification: High-risk system requiring extensive documentation
- Safety case development: 80% complete, targeting submission in Q1 2026
- Insurance framework: Negotiations ongoing with specialty carriers
- Public acceptance: Community engagement program showing positive results
- Key risk: Regulatory changes during implementation timeline

**Action Items:**
- Complete safety case documentation by November 15
- Schedule community stakeholder meetings in deployment cities
- Finalize insurance coverage terms by October 31

### 4. Operational Deployment Plan (Jennifer Kim)
- Phase 1: Limited deployment in 3 cities starting Q1 2026
- Initial fleet size: 50 vehicles across urban and suburban routes
- 24/7 monitoring center established with redundant staffing
- Customer onboarding: Digital app with real-time tracking
- Revenue model: Premium pricing with subscription options

**Challenges Identified:**
- Driver transition program for affected staff
- Maintenance facility upgrades for autonomous systems
- Cybersecurity hardening requirements

### 5. Legal and Liability Framework (Lisa Wong)
- Comprehensive liability analysis completed
- Product liability insurance secured with $500M coverage
- Regulatory compliance framework established
- Data privacy protocols for passenger information
- Key concern: Cross-border operations liability

**Action Items:**
- Review contract terms with insurance providers
- Develop incident response protocols
- Prepare regulatory filing documentation

### 6. Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning
- Technical fallback: Manual override capability maintained
- Operational contingency: Backup driver availability
- Market contingency: Phased rollout with early exit options
- Financial contingency: Insurance coverage and reserve funds

### 7. Next Steps and Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Finalize deployment cities and regulatory submissions
- **Week 3-4:** Complete staff training and system validation
- **Month 2:** Begin phased rollout with close monitoring
- **Month 3:** Evaluate performance metrics and adjust operations

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. Proceed with Q1 2026 limited deployment in 3 cities
2. Maintain conservative operating parameters for initial phase
3. Invest additional $2M in adverse weather sensor technology
4. Establish dedicated autonomous operations monitoring center

**Open Questions:**
- Should we partner with ride-sharing companies for initial deployment?
- How do we handle media and public communications during rollout?
- What metrics will determine success of Phase 1?

**Next Meeting:** October 12, 2025 - Deployment Readiness Review
