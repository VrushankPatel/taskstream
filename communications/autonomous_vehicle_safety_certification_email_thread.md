Team,

Following our recent safety testing phase, I wanted to provide an update on our autonomous vehicle certification progress.

**Current Status:**
- Completed 10,000 miles of test driving across various conditions
- Safety metrics exceed regulatory requirements by 25%
- Identified 3 minor software issues requiring fixes

**Next Steps:**
- Final regulatory submission due September 30
- Pilot deployment planning for Q4 2025
- Full fleet transition targeted for Q2 2026

We're on track for certification. The testing results are very encouraging.

Best,  
Robert Martinez

Excellent progress! The safety metrics are impressive. Can you share more details on the software issues identified? We need to ensure our maintenance teams are prepared.

Lisa,

The software issues were:
1. Edge case handling in extreme weather conditions (resolved)
2. Sensor calibration drift over time (monitoring system implemented)
3. Emergency override response time (optimized)

All fixes have been tested and validated. Training materials for maintenance teams will be distributed next week.

Regards,  
Robert
