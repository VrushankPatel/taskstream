## Email Thread: Branch Network Optimization Announcement

**From:** CEO  
**To:** All Employees  
**Subject:** Important Update: Branch Network Optimization Initiative  

**Date:** September 20, 2024  

Dear Team,

After careful analysis and consideration, we've made the difficult decision to optimize our branch network to better serve our customers in the digital age. This involves closing 8 underperforming branches and converting 5 others into community financial centers.

**Why This Change:**
- 65% of transactions now occur digitally
- Customer feedback shows preference for digital services
- This will allow us to invest more in technology and online services

**Timeline:**
- Affected branches will close by December 31st
- Community centers will open in January
- All employees will be offered positions or severance packages

**Support for Employees:**
- Career transition counseling available
- Retraining programs for digital roles
- Outplacement services for those leaving

This is a significant change, but necessary for our long-term success. We'll be communicating with customers about these changes and the enhanced digital services available.

Thank you for your understanding and continued dedication.

Best,  
Robert Kim

Robert,

I'm disappointed to hear about the downtown branch closure. This location has served the community for 25 years and has strong customer loyalty. Have you considered the impact on elderly customers who prefer in-person service?

Could we discuss converting it to a community center instead of closing entirely?

Best,

Maria,

Thank you for your feedback and for your years of service. We did consider the community impact extensively, which is why we're converting some branches to financial education centers that will still provide in-person services for basic transactions and financial counseling.

I'd be happy to discuss the downtown location specifically. Could you join our town hall meeting next week where we'll address individual branch questions?

Maria,

To address your concerns about employee support: we're offering comprehensive transition packages including 6 months severance, career counseling, and priority hiring for any open positions. Several team members from affected branches have already expressed interest in our growing digital services team.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss individual situations.

Best,  
Jennifer Walsh
