**Subject:** Urgent: Crisis Communication Strategy for Depositor Confidence  

Team,

Following the recent negative media coverage and economic uncertainty, we're seeing increased customer inquiries about account safety. I recommend we activate our crisis communication protocol immediately.

Key actions needed:
1. Prepare customer reassurance messaging
2. Coordinate with regulatory communications
3. Monitor social media sentiment
4. Prepare executive statements

Please advise on timeline and approval process.

Best,  
Sarah Johnson  
Head of Communications

Michael,

Liquidity position is solid - we have sufficient reserves. I've attached the summary. However, we should prepare contingency messaging if withdrawals increase.

Team,

Customer behavior analysis shows 15% increase in online banking logins but no unusual withdrawal patterns yet. Social media monitoring indicates moderate concern but no panic. Recommend proactive communication rather than reactive.
