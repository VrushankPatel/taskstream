## Email Thread: International Regulatory Compliance Update

**Subject:** Urgent: Implementation of Enhanced International Compliance Framework  

Team,

Following our recent board meeting and discussions with international regulators, I need to provide an update on our enhanced compliance framework for cross-border operations.

As you know, the new EU DORA regulations and US regulatory changes require significant updates to our compliance infrastructure. Our assessment shows we need to allocate $12M for technology upgrades and staff training.

Key requirements:
1. Enhanced transaction monitoring systems
2. Cross-border reporting automation  
3. Staff certification programs
4. Third-party vendor risk assessments

I've attached the detailed implementation plan. We need executive approval by end of quarter to meet the June 2026 compliance deadline.

Please review and let me know if you need any clarifications.

Best,  
Sarah Chen  
Chief Compliance Officer

Sarah,

This is critical for our international expansion plans. Can you schedule a call with the exec team tomorrow to walk through the budget implications? We need to ensure this doesn't impact our Q2 growth targets.

Also, how does this align with our existing compliance investments?

Thanks,  
Michael Rodriguez  
CEO

Michael,

I've reviewed the budget. The $12M is within our compliance budget allocation, but we'll need to reallocate from other initiatives. The ROI analysis shows 3x return through reduced regulatory fines.

I recommend we proceed but phase the implementation to minimize cash flow impact.

Thank you both for the quick feedback. I've scheduled the exec call for 2 PM tomorrow.

To address Michael's question - this builds on our existing AML/KYC infrastructure but adds cross-border specific capabilities. The phased approach David suggested makes sense.

Regional managers - please prepare your local implementation plans for the call.
