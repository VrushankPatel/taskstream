**Subject:** Urgent: New Regulatory Requirements for Anti-Money Laundering Controls

**Date:** October 15, 2025

Team,

Following the recent regulatory updates from FinCEN, I need to bring to your immediate attention new AML requirements that will impact our operations. The new rules require enhanced customer due diligence for high-risk accounts and expanded transaction monitoring capabilities.

Key changes:
1. Enhanced KYC for accounts over $50,000
2. Real-time transaction monitoring implementation
3. Monthly suspicious activity reporting

This will require significant system upgrades and staff training. I've attached the full regulatory guidance for your review.

We need to form a cross-functional task force to assess our current compliance posture and develop an implementation plan.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Chief Compliance Officer

Sarah,

Thank you for the heads-up. This sounds like a major undertaking. Can you provide:

1. Estimated timeline for compliance
2. Budget impact
3. Potential operational disruptions

We cannot afford any compliance violations given the current regulatory environment.

Regards,
Michael Torres

Adding to Michael's points - we need to understand the capital allocation implications. If this requires new systems, we should evaluate whether to build internally or partner with vendors.

Also, how does this align with our digital transformation initiative? Can we leverage existing investments?

From IT perspective, the real-time monitoring requirement will be challenging with our current legacy systems. We're already planning AML system upgrades as part of our 2026 budget, but this accelerates the timeline significantly.

I recommend we engage with our current vendor partners immediately to assess readiness.

Thank you all for the quick responses. To address your questions:

**Timeline:** We have 12 months from effective date (January 1, 2026) for full compliance. Pilot implementation should start Q1 2026.

**Budget Impact:** Estimated $2.8M for system upgrades, $1.2M for training, $800K for consulting support.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal disruption if we phase implementation. High-risk accounts will require additional review time initially.

I've scheduled a task force meeting for next Tuesday to develop detailed implementation plan. Please let me know if you need any additional information before then.

Best,
Sarah
