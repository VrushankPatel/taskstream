## Email Thread: Gene Editing Ethics Committee Discussion

**From:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Lead Scientist

**Subject:** Urgent Discussion Needed: CRISPR Ethics Framework for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Trial
**Date:** October 15, 2025

Team,

Following our recent breakthrough in CRISPR-based exon skipping for DMD, I need to convene an urgent ethics committee meeting. Our preclinical data shows 85% correction of the dystrophin gene in mouse models, but we're seeing some off-target edits in non-coding regions.

Key concerns:
1. Long-term safety implications of germline vs. somatic editing
2. Equitable access for underserved populations
3. Informed consent challenges for pediatric patients
4. International regulatory harmonization

Can we schedule for next Tuesday at 2 PM? I've attached the preliminary ethics assessment.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

This is indeed urgent. I've reviewed your assessment and agree we need immediate discussion. The off-target editing concern is particularly troubling given the pediatric population.

I'll arrange the meeting for Tuesday. Please prepare:
- Detailed risk-benefit analysis
- Alternative therapeutic approaches comparison
- Patient advocacy group input
- Regulatory precedent analysis

We should also invite our patient advisory board representative.

Michael,

Thank you for the quick response. I've updated the risk assessment with the latest off-target data - it's lower than initially feared but still requires careful monitoring.

I'll prepare the requested materials and reach out to the patient advocacy group. Should we also loop in our regulatory consultants for the international harmonization discussion?

Good point, Sarah. I've added our regulatory consultants to the distribution.

Meeting confirmed for Tuesday, October 22 at 2 PM. Conference room A. Agenda attached.

This discussion will shape our approach to gene editing therapies for years to come.
