# Email Thread: Gene Therapy Ethics Discussion

**From:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Bioethics Committee Chair

**Subject:** Urgent Discussion: Ethical Considerations for Gene Therapy Advancement
**Date:** September 28, 2025

Team,

Following our preclinical success with the CRISPR-based gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, I need to convene an urgent ethics discussion. Our data shows 85% efficacy in animal models, but we've identified potential off-target editing in germline cells that could have generational implications.

Key concerns to address:
1. Germline editing implications for future generations
2. Equity of access to expensive gene therapies
3. Long-term safety monitoring requirements
4. Patient consent and understanding of risks

Please review the attached ethics assessment report. I propose we schedule a committee meeting for next Tuesday at 2 PM to discuss our path forward.

This decision will determine whether we proceed to IND filing or conduct additional safety studies.

Best,
Dr. Sarah Chen
Bioethics Committee Chair

Sarah,

Thank you for raising this critical issue. The science team has been wrestling with these same concerns. While our preclinical data is compelling, the germline editing risk cannot be dismissed.

I recommend we engage external ethicists from the National Academies to provide independent review. This would strengthen our position with regulators and demonstrate our commitment to responsible development.

The potential to cure cystic fibrosis in children born with the most severe mutations is enormous, but we must get this right.

Adding to Michael's point - from a regulatory perspective, FDA has been clear that germline editing for therapeutic purposes remains controversial. Our recent discussions with FDA reviewers suggest they would require:

1. Comprehensive germline safety data
2. Multi-generational animal studies
3. Enhanced informed consent protocols
4. Long-term follow-up registries

The additional studies could add 18-24 months to our timeline. We need to decide if this is acceptable or if we should focus on somatic cell editing approaches that avoid germline risks entirely.

Thank you both for your thoughtful responses. This discussion highlights why we established our bioethics committee.

I've scheduled the meeting for Tuesday at 2 PM in Conference Room A. We'll also have representatives from patient advocacy groups joining virtually.

Agenda items:
1. Review preclinical data and germline risks
2. Discuss regulatory landscape and alternatives
3. Consider patient community perspectives
4. Develop recommendation for leadership

Please come prepared with your positions. This will be a pivotal decision for our company's future and the field of gene therapy.

Sarah
