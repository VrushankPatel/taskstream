## Email Thread: Q1 Marketing Campaign Budget Request

**From:** Lisa Thompson, Director of Marketing
**To:** Robert Jenkins, CFO; Jennifer Walsh, CEO
**Subject:** Budget Approval Request: Q1 Demand Generation Campaign
**Date:** November 20, 2025

Robert and Jennifer,

As discussed in our quarterly planning session, I'm submitting a formal budget request for our Q1 demand generation campaign. This initiative is critical to achieving our 2026 revenue targets.

**Campaign Overview:**
- Target: 500 qualified leads in Q1
- Channels: Paid search, social media, content syndication
- Timeline: January 1 - March 31, 2026
- Total Budget: $285,000

**Budget Breakdown:**
- Digital Advertising: $150,000 (53%)
- Content Creation: $75,000 (26%)
- Marketing Technology/Software: $45,000 (16%)
- Agency Fees: $15,000 (5%)

**Expected ROI:**
- Projected revenue from campaign: $1.2M
- Customer acquisition cost: $570 (industry average $750)
- Payback period: 4.2 months

**Justification:**
Our current lead pipeline shows a 30% gap to reach Q1 quota. This campaign addresses the gap while building brand awareness in the enterprise security segment.

Attached: Detailed campaign plan, competitive analysis, and ROI model.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Lisa Thompson

Lisa,

Thanks for the detailed request. I've reviewed the ROI model and the numbers look solid. However, I have a couple of concerns:

1. The software budget seems high - can we leverage existing tools rather than purchasing new ones?
2. Have we factored in the recent ad platform price increases (Google announced 15% increases starting Q1)?

Can we schedule a 15-minute call tomorrow to discuss optimization opportunities? I'd like to get this approved but want to ensure we're being efficient.

Robert,

Happy to discuss tomorrow. Regarding your points:

1. The software investment is for advanced attribution tracking that our current tools don't support. Without it, we'll have poor visibility into campaign performance.
2. I haven't factored in the Google increases yet - that's another $22,500. We may need to adjust channel mix.

I can shift $30K from content creation to cover the increases if needed.

Lisa and Robert,

This campaign is important for Q1 momentum. Robert, please work with Lisa to optimize where possible, but don't cut into the core campaign effectiveness.

Lisa, proceed with the revised budget including the Google price adjustments. We need those leads.

Approved: $307,500 (revised for ad platform increases)

Jennifer
