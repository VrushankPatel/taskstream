Team,

We've received reports of contaminated product batches affecting approximately 5% of our recent shipments. Quality control has confirmed the issue and we're initiating a voluntary recall.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Halt all social media posting until further notice
2. Prepare customer notification templates
3. Activate crisis response hotline
4. Monitor social channels for customer concerns

Please acknowledge receipt and confirm your team's readiness. Emergency briefing at 9 AM in the main conference room.

Jennifer,

Social media team is standing by. We've paused all scheduled content and prepared the recall announcement post. Should we go live with the announcement now or wait for the official press release?

Also, monitoring shows initial customer complaints appearing on Twitter and Facebook. Should we respond individually or direct to the hotline?

Marcus,

Hold the announcement until Legal reviews the language. Press release goes out at 10 AM, then we can post simultaneously.

For individual complaints: Direct all customers to the crisis hotline (1-800-CRISIS) with the message: "We're aware of the issue and taking immediate action. Please call our crisis hotline for assistance."

Legal - please review the social media copy ASAP. We need to be precise about affected batches without causing unnecessary panic.

Jennifer,

Legal has reviewed the copy. One suggested change: Add "We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause" to the opening statement.

Also, ensure all responses include the batch codes: LOT-2025-089 through LOT-2025-095.

Approved for release.

Thank you everyone for the swift response. Crisis is contained for now. We'll reconvene at 2 PM for a full debrief.

Key learnings so far:
- Response time was excellent (under 2 hours from initial report)
- Clear communication prevented escalation
- Crisis hotline effectively managed customer inquiries
