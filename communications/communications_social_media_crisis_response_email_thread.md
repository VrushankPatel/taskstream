## Email Thread: Social Media Crisis Response Coordination

**From:** VP Communications

**Subject:** URGENT: Social Media Crisis Response - Customer Service Failure Going Viral

Team,

We have a developing crisis situation. A customer service interaction that went wrong has been posted on TikTok and is going viral. The video currently has 2.7M views and climbing rapidly. Key issues:

- Customer waited 3 hours on hold
- Representative was unprofessional
- No resolution provided
- Our brand is being tagged negatively

Social listening shows sentiment dropping 40% in the last 2 hours. We need immediate coordinated response.

Proposed actions:
1. Direct apology from CEO on all platforms
2. Refund offer to affected customer
3. Temporary hold on social media advertising
4. Influencer partnership for positive messaging

Please advise on approval and any additional recommendations.

Best,
Maria Rodriguez
VP Communications

Maria,

This is unacceptable. Approve all proposed actions immediately. I'll record the CEO apology video within the hour.

We also need:
- Root cause analysis of why this happened
- Immediate training refresh for customer service team
- 24/7 crisis monitoring until sentiment recovers

Let's get ahead of this before it spreads further.

Agreed on immediate response. I've paused all paid social campaigns and redirected budget to crisis response.

For the positive messaging, I recommend partnering with 5 micro-influencers in our target demographic. We have relationships ready to activate.

Also suggest we prepare a "behind the scenes" content series showing our improved customer service processes once this blows over.

Legal review completed on apology statement and refund offer. Both approved with minor wording changes for liability protection.

Remind everyone: No admissions of fault in public statements. Stick to empathy and commitment to improvement.

Also, document everything for potential litigation.

Response posts are live across all platforms. CEO video posted 45 minutes ago and already has 150K views.

Influencer partnerships activated - first posts going live in 2 hours.

Monitoring shows initial engagement spike, but sentiment still negative. Will continue tracking through the night.
