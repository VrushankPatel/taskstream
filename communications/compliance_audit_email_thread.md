Our annual SOX compliance audit is scheduled for October 15-25. This is a critical process to ensure we maintain our regulatory compliance and avoid any material weaknesses.

**Key Requirements:**
- All financial controls documentation must be updated and reviewed
- Process narratives and flowcharts need to be current
- Testing evidence from the past year should be compiled
- Any control deficiencies must be remediated by October 1

Please confirm your department's readiness and assign a point person for the audit team by September 25.

Thanks for the heads up. Finance will lead the financial reporting controls. We'll have our documentation ready by September 30.

One concern: we're still implementing the new ERP system, which has impacted some of our month-end close processes. Should we include interim controls in our testing?

Thanks for the quick responses. Good to see everyone is prepared.

@Finance Director: Yes, please include interim controls for the ERP implementation. The auditors will want to see how you're managing the transition.

We'll have a prep meeting on October 5 to walk through the audit plan. Please send your point persons the calendar invite.

Sorry for the delay. Sales controls are documented and tested. We're implementing a new CRM system, similar to Finance's ERP situation.

**Subject:** SOX Audit Update - Deficiency Remediation Required  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  

Following our prep meeting, the audit team identified 3 control deficiencies that need immediate remediation:

1. IT Access Reviews: Monthly reviews not completed for Q2
2. Revenue Recognition: New contract approval process not fully implemented
3. Inventory Controls: Cycle count procedures not followed in 2 warehouses

Please provide remediation plans by October 7. We'll need to demonstrate these are fixed before the audit begins.
