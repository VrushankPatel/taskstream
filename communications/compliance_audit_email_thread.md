### Finance Department Response

**From:** David Chen, Finance Director  
**To:** Maria Rodriguez, Executive Leadership Team  
**Date:** September 21, 2025 07:15  
**Subject:** Re: SOX Audit - Finance Department Readiness & ERP Implementation Impact

Maria,

**FINANCE DEPARTMENT STATUS:**

**Ready for Audit:**
- Revenue recognition documentation updated for new ASC 606 compliance
- AR aging and collection processes fully documented with Q3 testing complete
- Financial close checklist revised for 3-day close target (achieved in Q3)
- All 23 finance controls tested with zero exceptions in Q3

**CRITICAL ISSUE - ERP Implementation Impact:**

Our **Oracle ERP Cloud** implementation (Go-live: August 1, 2025) has introduced interim manual controls during the parallel run period. Key concerns:

1. **Month-End Close Process:** Hybrid manual/automated procedures through September 
2. **Reporting Controls:** New system reports require validation against legacy system
3. **User Access:** Transitional access matrix while deprovisioning old system users

**PROPOSED AUDIT APPROACH:**
- Document interim control procedures as temporary compensating controls
- Provide detailed ERP implementation timeline and testing results
- Include post-implementation monitoring evidence from August-September

**AUDIT LIAISON:** Jennifer Martinez, Assistant Finance Director (SOX-experienced, 8 years)

**DELIVERABLES STATUS:**
- Control matrices: 95% complete (target: September 28)
- Process documentation: 100% complete
- Testing evidence: 100% complete
- ERP cut-over documentation: 90% complete (target: September 27)

Let me know if you need detailed ERP implementation risk assessment for auditor discussions.
