Team,

We're experiencing critical integration issues with our new BIM software implementation on the Downtown Office Complex project. The Revit models are not syncing properly with our project management platform, causing delays in coordination meetings.

Key issues:
1. Model version conflicts between design consultants
2. Clash detection reports not generating automatically
3. Mobile access limitations for field teams

We need to resolve this by COB Friday to avoid further schedule slippage.

Best,  
Project Manager

Thanks for flagging this. I've identified the root cause - our cloud storage permissions aren't configured correctly for the external consultants. 

Proposed solution:
- Update access protocols for design team
- Implement automated version control workflow
- Schedule training session for all stakeholders

I can have this resolved by Thursday if IT can prioritize the permission updates.

Understood the urgency. I've reviewed the integration requirements and can implement the necessary permission updates and API configurations. However, this will require temporary downtime of the project collaboration platform during off-hours.

Timeline:
- Permission updates: Complete by Wednesday
- API integration testing: Thursday morning
- User acceptance testing: Thursday afternoon

Please confirm this approach works for the project timeline.

Approved. Let's proceed with the IT plan. Project Manager, please coordinate with the design team to ensure they're available for Thursday testing.

Also, this highlights the need for our BIM implementation roadmap to include better change management processes. Let's discuss this in next week's leadership meeting.

Confirmed with design team - they'll be available Thursday. I've also scheduled a post-implementation review for next Tuesday to document lessons learned.

Thanks for the quick response team.
