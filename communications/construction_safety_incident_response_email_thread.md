**Subject:** Urgent: Safety Incident Report - Fall from Ladder at Downtown Project

Team,

I need to report a serious safety incident that occurred this morning at the Downtown Project site. A worker fell approximately 12 feet from a ladder while installing electrical conduits on the 3rd floor. The worker has been transported to the hospital for evaluation.

**Incident Details:**
- Time: 9:15 AM
- Location: 3rd floor electrical room
- Worker: John Smith (Electrical subcontractor)
- Injury: Suspected broken ankle and concussion
- Witnesses: 2 other electrical workers

The worker was wearing a safety harness but it appears the ladder was not properly secured. This is being treated as a serious incident requiring immediate investigation.

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- Called 911 and provided first aid
- Secured the incident area
- Notified subcontractor's safety officer
- Stopped all work in the affected area

Please advise on next steps. I will conduct a preliminary investigation this afternoon.

John,

Thank you for the quick notification. This is concerning. I've spoken with the site supervisor who confirms the area has been secured and work has stopped in that zone.

**Additional Information:**
- The ladder was an extension ladder that should have been tied off
- Worker has 5 years experience with our company
- Safety harness was inspected and functional

I've notified the insurance claims department and will coordinate with legal for the investigation. Let's schedule an emergency safety meeting for tomorrow morning at 8 AM to review all safety protocols.

Team,

This incident is unacceptable. Safety is our top priority, and we cannot tolerate preventable accidents. I've reviewed the initial report and am deeply concerned.

**Executive Actions:**
1. All construction work at the Downtown project is suspended until the investigation is complete and corrective actions implemented
2. I'm flying in tomorrow to personally oversee the investigation
3. We're implementing immediate safety stand-down across all projects for safety refresher training

John (Safety), please prepare a comprehensive incident investigation report by end of day tomorrow. Sarah (PM), coordinate with the subcontractor to ensure they're also conducting their own investigation.

We will not resume work until I'm satisfied that all safety protocols are being followed.

Michael,

Understood. I've already begun the investigation and will have the preliminary report ready by tomorrow afternoon.

**Investigation Plan:**
- Interview witnesses and the injured worker (once medically cleared)
- Review safety protocols and training records
- Inspect all ladders and safety equipment on site
- Assess subcontractor safety procedures

The worker is stable at the hospital with a broken ankle. No concussion diagnosed. He'll be out for 6-8 weeks.

Michael,

I've coordinated with the subcontractor leadership. They're conducting their own investigation and have suspended the electrical crew pending results. They're also providing replacement safety equipment for all their workers.

The project timeline will be impacted by approximately 2 weeks due to the work stoppage and investigation.
