## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Current Delivery Challenges
- Inconsistent project scoping leading to scope creep (25% of projects)
- Variable quality in deliverables across practice areas
- Client satisfaction scores averaging 7.8/10, below target of 9.0
- Resource allocation inefficiencies causing burnout in high performers

### 2. Proposed Standardized Framework
**Core Components:**

- Standardized scoping templates and checklists
- Client communication protocols and cadence
- Quality assurance checkpoints at each phase

**Key Features:**
- Risk assessment matrix for each project type
- Change management protocols for scope adjustments
- Knowledge capture and reuse mechanisms

### 3. Pilot Program Results
**Pilot Projects:** 8 projects across 4 practice areas (Strategy, Operations, Technology, HR)

**Quantitative Results:**
- Average project completion time reduced by 18%
- Scope change requests decreased by 35%
- Client satisfaction improved to 8.7/10
- Consultant utilization improved by 12%

**Qualitative Feedback:**
- "Framework provides clear structure without being overly prescriptive"
- "Client communications more consistent and professional"
- "Easier to onboard new consultants to projects"

**Lessons Learned:**
- Need for more flexibility in creative/problem-solving projects
- Additional training required for framework adoption
