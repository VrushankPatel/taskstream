Team,

I'm providing an update on the AI recommendation engine failure that occurred yesterday morning, along with our response and recovery plan.

### Incident Summary
At 8:15 AM, our primary AI recommendation system experienced a critical failure due to corrupted training data introduced during the recent model update. This affected:
- Product recommendation accuracy across e-commerce platform
- Customer personalization features
- Inventory optimization algorithms
- Marketing campaign targeting

### Immediate Response Actions
- **System Isolation**: Immediately took affected systems offline to prevent data corruption spread
- **Backup Activation**: Switched to backup recommendation algorithms (70% accuracy vs. 95% normal)
- **Customer Communication**: Issued service notice to customers via app notifications and website banner
- **Investigation Team**: Assembled cross-functional team including AI engineers, data scientists, and security experts

### Root Cause Analysis
Preliminary investigation revealed:
- Data pipeline corruption during automated model retraining
- Insufficient validation checks on training data quality
- Lack of real-time monitoring for data drift detection

### Recovery Plan
**Phase 1 (Complete - 24 hours)**: Emergency stabilization and backup system activation
**Phase 2 (48 hours)**: Data cleansing and model retraining with enhanced validation
**Phase 3 (1 week)**: Full system restoration with improved monitoring
**Phase 4 (2 weeks)**: Implementation of preventive measures and additional safeguards

### Business Impact
- Estimated revenue impact: $2.1 million in lost sales
- Customer experience disruption: 45 minutes average outage time
- Recovery expected: Full functionality restored within 48 hours

### Preventive Measures
