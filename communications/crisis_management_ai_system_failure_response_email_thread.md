We have detected a critical failure in our AI diagnostic system affecting patient recommendations across 15 hospital partners. The system is generating incorrect diagnostic suggestions, potentially impacting patient care.

**Incident Details:**
- Time of detection: 2:45 AM EDT
- Affected systems: AI Diagnostic Engine v2.3
- Impact: Incorrect recommendations for cardiac and pulmonary cases
- Number of affected cases: 47 in last 24 hours
- Root cause: Software bug in probability weighting algorithm

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- System isolated to prevent further incorrect outputs
- Manual override activated for all diagnostic recommendations
- Emergency engineering team assembled
- Initial notification sent to affected hospital partners

**Current Status:**
- System offline for diagnostic recommendations
- Manual processes activated
- Engineering team working on hotfix
- Expected recovery: 24 hours

**Required Actions:**
1. Communications: Prepare stakeholder notifications
2. Legal: Assess regulatory reporting requirements
3. Customer Success: Support affected hospital partners
4. Engineering: Complete root cause analysis and fix

This is a high-priority patient safety issue. Please respond immediately with your action plans.

3. Independent review of all affected cases
4. Temporary suspension of AI recommendations until validated

**Questions:**
- How did this happen?
- What's the confidence in the manual override?
- Impact on our clinical trials?

I'll be in the office in 30 minutes. Let's have a crisis call at 4:00 AM.
