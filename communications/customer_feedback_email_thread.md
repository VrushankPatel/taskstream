**Subject:** Urgent: Customer Feedback on Recent Product Update

Team,

I received concerning feedback from our key account at TechCorp this morning. Mike Chen, their CTO, reached out directly about the latest dashboard update.

Key issues raised:
- Performance degradation since v2.1 release
- Missing features that were promised in roadmap
- Poor communication about breaking changes

They're threatening to explore alternative solutions if we don't address this within 48 hours.

I've scheduled a call with their team for tomorrow at 2 PM EST. Can we get engineering and product on this?

Thanks,
Sarah

Sarah,

Thanks for the heads up. I've looped in the engineering team.

Mike - we're taking this very seriously. The performance issues were unexpected and we're investigating the root cause now. Our team will have a fix ready by EOD today.

For the missing features, those were deprioritized due to technical constraints, but we can discuss reprioritization.

Let's use the call tomorrow to walk through our action plan.

Best,
David

Sarah and David,

Appreciate the quick response. The performance issues are impacting our daily operations significantly. We have 200+ users affected.

The missing features were critical for our Q4 planning. Without them, we're looking at significant rework.

Looking forward to tomorrow's call to understand the timeline for resolution.

Best,
Mike
