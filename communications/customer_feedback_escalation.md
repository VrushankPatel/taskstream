**Date:** December 5, 2025  

**Account Details:**
- Customer: TechCorp Enterprises
- Account Value: $850K ARR
- Relationship Length: 3 years
- CSM: Jennifer Liu

**Issue Summary:**
TechCorp has notified us of their intent to cancel their enterprise contract effective February 28, 2026. This follows multiple unresolved technical issues and perceived lack of product roadmap alignment with their needs.

**Timeline of Events:**
- October 15: Initial complaint about API performance issues
- November 2: Follow-up meeting - committed to fixes by November 30
- November 28: Issues not resolved, customer requested contract pause
- December 1: Escalated to engineering - promised resolution by December 15
- December 5: Customer sends formal cancellation notice

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. API reliability issues affecting their production systems
2. Delayed feature requests critical to their workflow
3. Inadequate communication during issue resolution
4. Competing vendor offering more responsive support

**Customer Requirements:**
- Immediate resolution of API issues
- Accelerated delivery of requested features
- Dedicated technical account manager
- Contract concessions for remaining term

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Schedule emergency meeting with customer executive team
2. **Technical:** Deploy engineering resources to resolve API issues within 48 hours
3. **Business:** Prepare retention package with contract concessions
4. **Strategic:** Assign dedicated account team and improve communication protocols

**Business Impact:**
- Loss of $850K ARR would impact FY26 revenue by 8%
- Potential negative reference affecting future sales
- Risk of competitive intelligence leakage

**Requested Support:**
- Executive involvement in customer meeting
- Approval for contract concessions up to $150K
- Priority engineering resource allocation

Please advise on next steps. Customer available for call tomorrow morning.

Best,

Jennifer,

This is concerning. TechCorp is one of our most important reference accounts. Let's get this resolved immediately.

Actions I'm taking:
1. Reaching out to their CEO directly
2. Preparing retention proposal with concessions
3. Coordinating cross-functional response team

CEO - your involvement will be crucial for the executive meeting.

Let's turn this around.
