**Subject:** Updated Data Governance Policy - Implementation Timeline

Team,

Following our quarterly data governance review, I've finalized updates to our data governance policy to address recent regulatory changes and incorporate lessons from the recent data breach incident.

Key updates include:
- Enhanced data classification framework with AI-assisted tagging
- Mandatory data quality monitoring for critical datasets
- Expanded data stewardship responsibilities
- New requirements for third-party data provider assessments

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Policy publication: August 1, 2024
- Training completion: September 15, 2024
- Full compliance: October 31, 2024

Please review the attached draft and provide feedback by July 28th. We'll hold a walkthrough session next Tuesday at 2 PM.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Chief Data Officer

Sarah,

The updates look comprehensive. One concern on the third-party assessment requirements - we should align this with our existing vendor risk management framework to avoid duplication.

Can we schedule a quick call to discuss integration points?

Regards,
Michael Torres
VP of Compliance
