**Subject:** Adaptive Learning Platform Rollout - Spring Semester  

Colleagues,

I'm pleased to announce the rollout of our new Adaptive Learning Platform across undergraduate STEM courses starting Spring 2026. This AI-powered system will personalize learning experiences for each student, adapting content difficulty and pacing based on individual performance.

Platform features:
- Real-time assessment and feedback
- Personalized learning pathways
- Predictive analytics for at-risk students
- Integration with existing LMS

Pilot results from Fall semester showed:
- 23% improvement in course completion rates
- 31% increase in student engagement scores
- 18% reduction in D/F grades

Training sessions will be held throughout December. Full implementation across all STEM departments by Fall 2026.

Maria,

This is exciting! Our calculus courses have struggled with varying student preparedness. The adaptive features should help address that. Can we get early access for curriculum mapping?

Also, how will this affect our current homework and assessment systems?

Best,

From IT perspective, we're ready for the rollout. The platform integrates well with our infrastructure, but we'll need to ensure adequate server capacity for the AI processing.

Key IT preparations:
- Bandwidth upgrades for video content delivery
- Student device compatibility testing
- Data privacy compliance for learning analytics
- 24/7 technical support staffing

We'll provide training materials and help desk resources.

This aligns perfectly with our student success initiatives. The predictive analytics will help us identify and support at-risk students earlier.

We'll coordinate:
- Academic advising integration with platform alerts
- Tutoring center alignment with adaptive recommendations
- Student orientation sessions on platform usage
- Accessibility compliance for diverse learners

I'm concerned about the time faculty will need to adapt their teaching methods. The platform sounds powerful, but we need adequate training and support during the transition.

Questions:
- How much curriculum redesign will be required?
- What professional development is available?
- Will there be a grace period for evaluation?

Thank you for the thoughtful responses and questions.

To address key concerns:
- Early access available for curriculum mapping starting January
- Comprehensive faculty training program with 40 hours of professional development
- Platform designed to complement existing teaching methods, not replace them
- Grace period for course evaluations during first semester of implementation

Detailed rollout plan and training schedule will be distributed next week. We're committed to supporting faculty through this transition to enhance student learning outcomes.
