## Meeting Notes: Education Adaptive Learning Technology Implementation

**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM
**Location:** Education Technology Center
**Attendees:**
- Dr. Sarah Chen, Academic Technology Director
- Prof. Michael Rodriguez, Curriculum Development Lead
- Lisa Park, Student Success Coordinator
- David Kumar, IT Infrastructure Manager
- James Wilson, Faculty Development Specialist

**Agenda:**
1. Current learning analytics assessment
2. Adaptive technology vendor evaluation
3. Implementation roadmap
4. Faculty training requirements

**Discussion Summary:**

**1. Learning Analytics Assessment**
- Current system provides basic engagement metrics (completion rates, time spent)
- Identified gaps in predictive analytics for at-risk students and personalized learning paths
- Critical need for seamless integration with existing LMS (Canvas) to avoid data silos
- Data privacy and FERPA compliance paramount - discussed anonymization techniques and consent protocols
- Potential for 25% improvement in student retention through early intervention

**2. Technology Evaluation**
- Evaluated three vendors: EduAdapt, LearnSmart AI, and IntelliPath
- Key evaluation criteria: AI recommendation accuracy (>90%), LMS integration ease, scalability, and total cost of ownership
- Winner selected: EduAdapt with 92% AI accuracy, native Canvas integration, and proven scalability
- Total implementation cost: $680K (software licenses: $450K, implementation: $150K, training: $80K)
- ROI projected at 3.2x within 3 years through improved completion rates and reduced support costs

**3. Implementation Roadmap**
- **Phase 1 (Pilot)**: Deploy in 3 high-enrollment courses starting January 2026 (4 months) - focus on data collection and user feedback
- **Phase 2 (Training & Redesign)**: Comprehensive faculty training and course content adaptation (6 months) - develop adaptive learning modules
- **Phase 3 (Full Rollout)**: Campus-wide deployment across all undergraduate programs (12 months) - phased approach by department
- **Phase 4 (Optimization)**: Advanced analytics implementation and continuous improvement (18 months) - predictive modeling and AI enhancements

**4. Training Requirements**
- Faculty training program: 40 hours total (20 hours online modules, 20 hours hands-on workshops)
- Student orientation: Integrated into existing course onboarding with 15-minute video tutorial
- Support staff training: 60 hours covering technical administration, pedagogical support, and troubleshooting
- Ongoing professional development: Quarterly workshops on emerging adaptive learning techniques

**Decisions Made:**
- Approved EduAdapt as preferred vendor with contract negotiation to begin immediately
- Established cross-functional implementation team with representatives from IT, Academic Affairs, and Student Services
- Committed to FERPA-compliant data handling with third-party audit scheduled for Q1 2026

**Risks Identified:**
- Faculty resistance to technology-driven curriculum changes
- Potential data privacy concerns with AI-driven personalization
- Integration challenges with legacy systems
- Student adaptation period and potential learning curve

**Success Metrics:**
- 90% faculty adoption rate within 12 months
- 15% improvement in course completion rates
- 20% reduction in academic advising inquiries
- Positive student satisfaction scores (>4.0/5.0)

**Action Items:**
- Sarah: Finalize vendor contract by October 15
- Michael: Develop course redesign guidelines by November 1
- Lisa: Create student communication plan by October 20
- David: Assess infrastructure requirements by October 31
- James: Design faculty training program by November 15

**Next Meeting:** November 12, 2025 - Pilot Program Kickoff

**Meeting Adjourned:** 3:30 PM
