This looks like a significant improvement over our current system. However, I'm concerned about the course migration timeline. Our department has over 200 courses that will need adaptation.

Can we extend the migration period or get additional support for content conversion?

Thank you for your feedback. We recognize the scope of work required for course migration.

We've allocated additional resources specifically for high-volume departments like Business Administration. You'll have dedicated migration specialists for 40 hours of support during November.

If this isn't sufficient, please let me know your specific needs so we can adjust our support plan.
