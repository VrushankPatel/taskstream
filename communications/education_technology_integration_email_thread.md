## Email Thread: Education Technology Integration Update

**From:** Director of Academic Technology
**To:** Academic Leadership Team
**Subject:** EdTech Integration: Progress and Next Steps

Colleagues,

I wanted to provide an update on our education technology integration initiative. We've made significant progress over the past quarter, but we're facing some implementation challenges that require your input.

**Current Status:**
- LMS migration completed for 80% of courses
- Student information system integration underway
- Faculty training program launched with 65% participation
- Student device distribution at 45% completion

**Key Achievements:**
- Improved online course completion rates by 22%
- Reduced administrative workload by 30% through automation
- Enhanced student engagement metrics across platforms

**Challenges Identified:**
- Integration issues between legacy systems and new EdTech platforms
- Faculty adoption resistance in certain departments
- Student digital literacy gaps in underserved populations
- Budget constraints for ongoing maintenance and support

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. Extend implementation timeline by 3 months
2. Increase faculty training budget by $150K
3. Develop targeted support programs for at-risk students
4. Form cross-departmental governance committee

I recommend we discuss these challenges at our next leadership meeting and make decisions on resource allocation.

Best regards,
Dr. Emily Rodriguez
Director of Academic Technology

Emily,

Thank you for the comprehensive update. The progress in Arts and Sciences has been impressive, but I share your concerns about faculty adoption. Many of our senior faculty members are struggling with the transition.

I support the additional training budget and would like to propose department-specific training sessions tailored to different disciplines. We should also consider peer mentoring programs where early adopters help their colleagues.

Thank you both for your insights. This is a critical initiative for our strategic goals.

Emily - please prepare a detailed proposal for the additional resources and timeline extension.

James - the department-specific training idea is excellent. Let's incorporate that into the plan.

We'll discuss this at the leadership meeting next Tuesday. Please come prepared with your recommendations.

Best,
Dr. Maria Sanchez
Provost
