- **Safe Environment:** Practice high-risk procedures without real-world consequences
- **Accessibility:** 24/7 access to training facilities regardless of physical location
- **Scalability:** Support unlimited concurrent users without resource constraints

### Getting Started

- **Equipment:** VR headsets available for checkout at the Technology Center
- **Training:** Mandatory 1-hour orientation session (schedule available on the portal)
