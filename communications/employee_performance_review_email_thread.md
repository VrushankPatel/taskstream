Hi Maria,

Thank you for the detailed summary. The development plan looks comprehensive and I'm excited to work on these areas.

One question about the executive presentation coaching - would this include actual presentation practice, or is it more theoretical?

Also, for the mentorship program, I'd like to suggest starting with Sarah in marketing, as we work closely on customer projects.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,
Alex Thompson

Maria, Alex,

Great discussion yesterday. Alex, you're already showing strong potential in the areas we discussed.

Regarding the presentation coaching, Maria and I discussed this - it will include both theoretical frameworks and practical presentation practice with feedback.

For mentorship, Sarah is an excellent choice. I'll coordinate with marketing to make the introduction.

Looking forward to seeing your growth in Q4.

Best,
David Chen

Alex,

Perfect - the coaching will include hands-on practice sessions. And Sarah is indeed a great match for your mentorship.

I'll send calendar invites for the coaching session and workshop next week.

Best,
Maria
