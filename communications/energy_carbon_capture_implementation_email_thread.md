## Email Thread: Carbon Capture Implementation Timeline Update

**From:** VP Sustainability
**To:** Executive Leadership Team
**Subject:** CCUS Project Timeline Acceleration - Urgent Update

Team,

Following our board meeting last week, I wanted to provide an update on the carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) implementation across our North American operations.

As you know, the EPA's proposed regulations will require 40% carbon capture on all new facilities starting 2027. Our current assessment shows we're behind schedule on the Permian Basin project.

Key issues:
1. Vendor delivery delays on capture units (8 weeks slippage)
2. Pipeline right-of-way negotiations stalled in Texas
3. Storage site certification taking longer than anticipated

I've attached the revised timeline showing first capture operations now targeted for Q2 2027 instead of Q4 2026. This pushes our compliance date to the absolute limit.

Recommendations:
- Increase contractor teams by 50% on critical path items
- Fast-track permitting through additional legal resources
- Consider interim carbon credit purchases as hedge

Please review and let me know if we need to escalate to the board for additional funding.

Best,
Sarah Chen
VP Sustainability

Sarah,

This is concerning. The Permian project represents 30% of our carbon reduction commitment. We cannot afford delays.

CFO - what's the cost impact of the acceleration plan?
COO - can we redeploy resources from the Eagle Ford retrofit?

We need options on the table by end of week.

Mark,

Acceleration would add $85M to the project cost, bringing total to $1.285B. This includes:
- $45M for additional contractor staffing
- $25M for expedited permitting fees
- $15M for interim carbon credits (2026-2027)

ROI still positive at 12% even with the increase, but we lose 6 months of carbon credits revenue.

Alternative: Phase implementation starting with highest-emitting sites first.

Let me know if you want to run scenarios.

We can redeploy 40 engineers from Eagle Ford, but it means pushing that completion back 4 months. Eagle Ford generates $120M quarterly, so we'd lose $480M in production revenue.

Recommend accelerating Permian with dedicated teams rather than robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Alternative: Bring in international engineering firm for parallel path execution.

Team,

After reviewing options, we're approving the acceleration plan:
- Add $85M to budget
- Hire additional 50 contractors
- Fast-track permitting with external legal
- Purchase interim credits as insurance

Sarah, please execute immediately and provide weekly updates.

This is critical for our ESG commitments and regulatory compliance.
