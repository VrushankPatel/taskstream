## Meeting Notes: Energy Storage Technology Deployment Strategy

**Date:** September 28, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
**Location:** Conference Room 12B
**Attendees:**
- John Ramirez, VP Grid Operations
- Dr. Emily Chen, Chief Technology Officer
- Mark Thompson, Regulatory Affairs Director
- Sarah Kim, Project Manager
- External: Dr. Robert Liu, Energy Storage Consultant

**Agenda:**
1. Current energy storage landscape review
2. Technology selection criteria
3. Regulatory considerations
4. Implementation timeline and budget
5. Risk assessment

**Discussion Summary:**

**1. Current Landscape Review**
- Grid faces increasing renewable energy integration challenges
- Battery storage costs have dropped 70% in past 5 years
- Lithium-ion remains dominant but flow batteries gaining traction for long-duration storage
- Pilot programs in 3 states show 15-20% grid stability improvement

**2. Technology Selection**
- Recommendation: Hybrid approach with lithium-ion for short-term (2-4 hours) and flow batteries for long-term (6-8 hours)
- Target: 500 MWh total capacity across 5 sites
- Priority sites: High-renewable penetration areas with grid congestion issues

**3. Regulatory Considerations**
- FERC approval required for interstate transmission integration
- State-level incentives available through IRA funding
- Environmental impact assessments needed for battery chemistry disposal
- Timeline: 6-9 months for full regulatory approval

**4. Implementation Timeline**
- Phase 1 (Q1 2026): Site selection and permitting - 3 months
- Phase 2 (Q2-Q3 2026): Equipment procurement and installation - 6 months
- Phase 3 (Q4 2026): Testing and commissioning - 3 months
- Go-live: January 2027

**5. Budget and Risk Assessment**
- Total budget: $180 million
- Funding sources: 40% utility capital, 35% federal grants, 25% private investment
- Key risks: Technology performance, regulatory delays, supply chain disruptions
- Mitigation: Pilot testing, diversified suppliers, contingency planning

**Action Items:**
- Sarah Kim: Develop detailed project charter by October 15
- Mark Thompson: Initiate regulatory consultation process
- Dr. Emily Chen: Finalize technology vendor shortlist
- John Ramirez: Present to board for approval by November 30

**Next Meeting:** October 15, 2025 - Detailed project planning session
