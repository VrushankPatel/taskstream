## Email Thread: Streaming Platform Distribution Rights Negotiation

**From:** VP Content Distribution
**To:** Legal Counsel, CEO, Content Acquisition Team
**Subject:** Q4 2025 Streaming Rights - Distribution Agreement Update

Team,

Following our recent negotiations with major streaming platforms, I wanted to provide an update on the distribution rights for our upcoming original series "Digital Shadows."

Key points from today's discussions:
- Netflix offering $45M for exclusive 18-month window
- Amazon Prime bidding $38M for 24-month exclusive + 12-month SVOD rights
- Our counter-offer of $52M for 12-month exclusive + perpetual SVOD rights

Legal has flagged potential antitrust concerns with exclusive deals >18 months. We need to balance revenue maximization with platform relationships.

Please review the term sheet attached and provide feedback by EOD Friday.

Best,
Sarah Chen
VP Content Distribution

Sarah,

Thanks for the update. On the antitrust concerns:

The 18-month threshold is indeed a concern under current DOJ guidelines. We recommend structuring as:
- 12-month exclusive window
- Followed by 6-month SVOD-only period
- With perpetual non-exclusive rights

This maintains revenue potential while reducing regulatory risk. I've attached a revised term sheet for your review.

Also, ensure we include audit rights for viewership data - that's been a sticking point in past deals.

Regards,
Michael Torres
Senior Counsel

Good discussion points. Sarah, can you model the financial impact of the 12+6 structure vs. the 18-month exclusive?

We need to hit our Q4 revenue targets, but not at the expense of future platform relationships. Let's schedule a call for Thursday to discuss strategy.

Also, what are the international distribution opportunities here?

Thanks,
Jennifer Walsh
CEO

Jennifer,

Financial modeling attached. The 12+6 structure projects $48M revenue vs. $52M for 18-month exclusive - a $4M delta but significantly lower regulatory risk.

International opportunities look strong:
- European markets: €12M across major platforms
- Asian markets: ¥800M through local partnerships
- Latin America: $8M through existing distributors

Call scheduled for Thursday 2 PM. Agenda attached.

Best,
Sarah
