**Subject:** Urgent: New Banking Regulatory Requirements - Implementation Timeline

Team,

Following the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday regarding enhanced capital requirements for regional banks, I wanted to provide immediate guidance on our response.

The new requirements include:
- Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio increase to 9.5% (from current 8.5%)
- Enhanced liquidity coverage ratio reporting
- Quarterly stress testing submissions
- Implementation deadline: March 31, 2025

This will require immediate action from Risk Management, Finance, and Operations teams. I've scheduled an emergency meeting for tomorrow at 10 AM to discuss implementation planning.

Please review the attached regulatory guidance document and prepare initial impact assessments for your departments.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
Chief Compliance Officer

Sarah,

Thanks for the quick communication. This is significant - our current Tier 1 ratio is at 8.7%, so we'll need to raise approximately $85M in additional capital.

Key concerns:
1. Market timing for capital raise
2. Impact on dividend payments
3. Cost of compliance implementation

Can we get the Fed's full guidance document circulated? Also, should we engage external consultants for the stress testing requirements?

Regards,
Michael Torres
Chief Financial Officer

Adding to Michael's points - the stress testing requirements are particularly complex. We'll need to enhance our scenario modeling capabilities significantly.

Current state assessment:
- Stress testing framework: Basic level, needs major upgrade
- Data quality: Good for core portfolios, gaps in derivatives
- Resources: Currently 3 FTEs, estimate need 8-10 for compliance

Recommend starting vendor evaluation immediately for stress testing software.

Thank you all for the quick responses. This is indeed a critical regulatory change that affects our strategic positioning.

Action items:
1. Sarah - circulate full Fed guidance and schedule meeting for tomorrow
2. Michael - prepare capital planning options by Friday
3. David - initiate vendor RFP for stress testing tools
4. All department heads - impact assessments due by COB Friday

We'll need to balance compliance costs with maintaining our competitive position. Let's ensure we're not over-engineering the solution.

Our operations impact assessment is attached. Key findings:

- Systems upgrades required for enhanced reporting
- Additional headcount needed: 5 FTEs for compliance reporting
- Training requirements for 200+ staff
- Estimated implementation cost: $2.8M

The liquidity reporting requirements will be the most operationally intensive.
