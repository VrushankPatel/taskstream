**Subject:** Budget Approval Request: New Downtown Branch Location

Team,

Following our strategic review meeting last month, I'm submitting the budget request for our new downtown branch location. The market analysis shows strong growth potential in the area, with our current nearest branch 3 miles away.

Key highlights:
- Total investment: $2.5M
- Projected annual revenue: $800K within 3 years
- ROI timeline: 36 months
- Market opportunity: 15% annual growth in target demographic

I've attached the detailed business case and financial projections. The site selection team has identified an optimal location with excellent visibility and parking.

Please let me know if you need any additional information for the board meeting next week.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Regional Expansion Manager

Sarah,

Thanks for the comprehensive business case. The financial projections look solid, and the ROI analysis is conservative but achievable. I've reviewed the cash flow projections and they align with our capital allocation strategy.

One question: Have we factored in the current interest rate environment for the financing portion? The projections show 4.5% borrowing costs, but we should stress-test at 6% given potential Fed moves.

Otherwise, I support moving forward to the board.

Regards,
Michael Chen

Good analysis all around. The market opportunity is compelling, and this fits well with our expansion strategy. Sarah, please prepare a 5-minute presentation for the board meeting.

Michael, good catch on the interest rate sensitivity. Let's include that in the board materials.

Approved to proceed.

Sarah,

Excellent progress on the implementation. The lease terms look favorable, and the marketing launch is well-timed.

One reminder: Ensure we track the ROI metrics closely from day one. The board will want detailed reporting on customer acquisition costs and deposit growth.

Looking forward to the grand opening.
