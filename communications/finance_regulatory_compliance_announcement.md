## Email Thread: New Regulatory Compliance Requirements

**From:** Chief Compliance Officer
**To:** All Employees
**Subject:** Important: Updated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Procedures

**Date:** October 15, 2024

Dear Team,

Following the recent regulatory updates from the Financial Conduct Authority, I need to inform you of important changes to our AML compliance procedures effective November 1st.

**Key Changes:**
- Enhanced customer due diligence requirements for high-risk clients
- Monthly transaction monitoring reports now required for all accounts
- New training modules for all staff handling customer transactions

These changes are designed to strengthen our compliance framework and ensure we maintain the highest standards of financial integrity. While this represents additional workload, it positions us well for the upcoming regulatory audit.

Please review the attached detailed procedure document and complete the online training module by October 31st. Your compliance is critical to our continued success.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact the Compliance team.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Chief Compliance Officer

Sarah,

Thanks for the clear communication. The operations team has reviewed the requirements and we have a few concerns:

1. The monthly reporting requirement will require approximately 20 additional hours per month from our team
2. We're currently understaffed in the compliance monitoring role
3. The new system integration may require additional IT support

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss resource allocation and potential process optimizations?

Best,
Mike Chen
Operations Manager
