**Subject:** Q3 Regulatory Reporting Timeline and Resource Requirements

Team,

Following the recent regulatory updates from the Federal Reserve, I need to provide an update on our Q3 reporting cycle. The new Basel III disclosure requirements are significantly increasing our reporting burden.

Key changes:
- Additional liquidity risk metrics required
- Enhanced counterparty credit risk disclosures
- New operational risk reporting standards

Current timeline shows we need additional resources to meet the October 15 deadline. We're currently 2 FTE short for the next 6 weeks.

Sarah,

This is concerning. Can you provide specific details on the resource gap and cost implications? We need to ensure compliance without compromising other priorities.

Also, have we explored automation solutions to address the increased workload?

Michael,

Resource gap details:
- 2 senior analysts needed for 6 weeks ($45K total cost)
- Additional review time: 40 hours for compliance team
- Training requirements: 20 hours for new disclosure formats

We've identified a regulatory reporting automation tool that could reduce manual effort by 60%. Implementation would cost $25K but save $80K annually.

Team,

Compliance is non-negotiable. Approve the temporary resources and move forward with the automation evaluation. Sarah, please prepare a detailed proposal for the automation solution by end of week.

Let's schedule a call for Thursday to discuss implementation.

David,

Understood. I'll have the automation proposal ready by Friday. Temporary resources approved - I'll coordinate with HR for immediate hiring.

Good plan. I've approved the budget for both temporary resources and automation evaluation. Let's ensure we meet the deadline without issues.
