**Performance Review**
Sarah presented Q4 results showing 12% outperformance in ESG-focused portfolios compared to traditional investments. Key highlights:

Client demand for ESG products has increased 40% YoY.

**Framework Evaluation**
Michael reviewed three sustainable finance frameworks:

- Potential carbon border adjustment mechanisms

**Portfolio Recommendations**

- Sarah: Complete framework implementation plan by November 15
- Michael: Prepare client communication materials for new ESG offerings
- Lisa: Update risk models to include climate scenario analysis
- James: Schedule regulatory compliance training for investment team

### Key Decisions
1. Adopt EU Taxonomy as primary ESG classification framework
