## Meeting Notes: Fraud Detection Automation Implementation

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM  
**Location:** Virtual (Zoom)  
**Attendees:** Tom Anderson (Chief Risk Officer), Rachel Kim (Fraud Analytics Lead), James Liu (IT Security Manager), Sarah Patel (Compliance Officer), Mark Johnson (Operations Manager)  
**Facilitator:** Tom Anderson  

### Agenda
1. Current fraud detection challenges
2. AI/ML solution overview
3. Implementation approach and timeline
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Success metrics and monitoring

### Discussion Summary

**Current Fraud Landscape:**
- Monthly fraud losses averaging $2.1M
- 40% of fraud cases detected manually, causing 5-7 day delays
- False positive rate of 15% leading to customer friction
- Increasing sophistication of fraud patterns (synthetic identities, account takeover)

**Key Challenges:**
- Legacy rule-based systems unable to adapt to new patterns
- Limited real-time processing capabilities
- Manual investigation bottleneck with 200+ daily alerts
- Integration gaps between fraud systems and core banking platform

**Proposed AI Solution:**
- Machine learning model for real-time transaction scoring
- Behavioral analytics for account monitoring
- Automated case prioritization and investigation workflows
- Integration with existing fraud management platform

**Implementation Approach:**
- Phase 1: Data preparation and model training (3 months)
- Phase 2: Parallel testing with existing system (2 months)
- Phase 3: Gradual rollout with 10% transaction coverage (1 month)
- Phase 4: Full production deployment and optimization (2 months)

**Timeline:** January 2026 full deployment

**Risk Assessment:**
- Model accuracy and bias concerns
- Regulatory compliance with automated decisions
- System performance impact on transaction processing
- Staff training and change management

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Extensive model validation and A/B testing
- Human oversight for high-risk transactions
- Regular model retraining and performance monitoring
- Comprehensive training program for fraud team

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in fraud losses within 6 months
- 70% decrease in manual investigation time
- 60% improvement in fraud detection accuracy
- 20% reduction in false positive alerts

### Action Items
- **Rachel Kim:** Complete vendor evaluation and recommend AI platform (Due: Nov 15)
- **James Liu:** Assess integration requirements with core systems (Due: Nov 10)
- **Sarah Patel:** Review regulatory requirements for automated fraud detection (Due: Nov 20)
- **Mark Johnson:** Develop change management plan for fraud team (Due: Nov 25)
- **Tom Anderson:** Present business case to executive committee (Due: Dec 1)

### Risks and Dependencies
- Data quality and availability for model training
- Computational resource requirements for real-time scoring
- Coordination with external fraud data providers
- Budget approval for AI platform licensing

### Next Meeting
November 15, 2025 - Vendor presentations and technical deep dive
