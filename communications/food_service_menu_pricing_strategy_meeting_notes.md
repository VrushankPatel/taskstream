### Current Menu Performance
- **Food cost percentage:** 32% (target: 28-30%)

**Key Insight:** Premium items driving profitability, but price sensitivity in lunch crowd affecting volume.

### Cost Optimization Opportunities

**Action Items:**
- Maria: Develop 3 new "value-enhanced" menu items using cost-optimized ingredients
- James: Implement portion control protocols
- Lisa: Model impact of 3-5% price increases on different menu categories

### Pricing Strategy Recommendations
- **Tiered pricing approach:**
  - Appetizers: $12-18 (maintain current)
  - Mains: $24-38 (3% increase on underperformers)
  - Desserts: $8-12 (2% increase)
- **Value communication:** New menu descriptions emphasizing quality ingredients and preparation
- **Happy hour adjustments:** Extend pricing promotions to drive traffic during slow periods

**Financial Projections:**
- Expected revenue increase: $180K annually
- Food cost reduction: $95K annually
- Net impact: $275K profit improvement

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Recipe testing and costing
- **Week 3:** Staff training and menu printing
