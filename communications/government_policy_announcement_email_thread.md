While I support the policy objectives, I have concerns about the security implications of the digital-first approach. We need to ensure that:

1. All systems meet the new privacy standards before launch
2. Staff receive adequate cybersecurity training
3. Incident response protocols are updated

I recommend adding a security review checkpoint before any service goes live.

Best,  
IT Security Director

Thank you for your feedback. I agree that security is paramount. We'll incorporate the security review checkpoint into the implementation timeline. The cross-departmental committee will include IT Security representation.

Let's schedule a kickoff meeting for next week to address any remaining concerns.

Best regards,  
Minister of Digital Government
