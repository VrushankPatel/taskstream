## Email Thread: Public Health Surveillance System Implementation

**Subject:** Implementation Timeline for Enhanced Public Health Surveillance System

Team,

Following our strategic planning session last month, I'm writing to provide an update on the implementation timeline for our enhanced public health surveillance system. This initiative is critical for improving our response capabilities to emerging health threats.

Key milestones:
- System design completion: March 15
- Data integration testing: April 30
- Pilot deployment in 2 counties: May 15
- Full system rollout: June 30

The total budget allocation of $4.2 million has been approved, with funding split between infrastructure ($2.8M) and training ($1.4M).

Please confirm your team's readiness for the kickoff meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at 10 AM.

Best regards,
Dr. Sarah Martinez
Director of Public Health

Dr. Martinez,

Thank you for the clear timeline. Our infrastructure team has completed the preliminary network assessment and we're prepared for the kickoff meeting.

One concern: The data center upgrade scheduled for Q2 might impact our deployment timeline if there are any delays. Should we build in a 2-week buffer?

Also, we'll need access to the county health data repositories by March 1st to begin integration testing.

Let me know if you need any additional information before Tuesday.

Regards,
Michael Chen
IT Infrastructure Lead

Adding to Michael's points - our analytics team has developed the initial dashboard prototypes and they're looking good. However, we're still waiting on final approval from the privacy review board for the data sharing protocols.

The pilot in May will be crucial for validating our predictive models. We should plan for a comprehensive evaluation after the 30-day pilot period.

Looking forward to Tuesday's meeting.

Best,
Dr. Lisa Wong
Data Analytics Director

Thank you all for the update. The commissioners are supportive of this initiative and understand its importance for community health.

We'd like to request a briefing for the full commission before the pilot launch in May. Also, please ensure that the system includes robust reporting capabilities for our quarterly public health updates.

Let us know if there are any policy decisions needed from our end.

Commissioner Johnson
