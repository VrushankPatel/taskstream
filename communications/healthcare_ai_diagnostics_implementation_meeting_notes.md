**Date:** September 28, 2025
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
**Location:** Medical Center Conference Room
**Attendees:** Chief Medical Officer, IT Director, Department Chiefs (Radiology, Pathology, Cardiology), AI Vendor Rep, Patient Safety Officer

## Agenda
1. Review clinical evaluation results
2. Discuss technical integration requirements
3. Address physician training and adoption
4. Evaluate implementation timeline and risks

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Clinical Evaluation Results
- **Radiology:** 94% accuracy in detecting abnormalities, 30% reduction in reading time
- **Pathology:** 96% accuracy in tissue analysis, improved consistency across pathologists
- **Cardiology:** 92% accuracy in ECG interpretation, reduced false positives by 40%
- **Overall Impact:** Expected 15% improvement in diagnostic accuracy across specialties

**Decision:** Proceed with implementation based on strong clinical evidence

### 2. Technical Integration Requirements
- **System Integration:** Seamless integration with existing EHR and PACS systems
- **Data Privacy:** HIPAA compliance and patient data protection measures
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-second response times for real-time diagnostics
- **Vendor Support:** 24/7 technical support and regular system updates

**Action Items:**
- Complete technical architecture review (IT Director)
- Finalize vendor contract terms (Procurement Team)

### 3. Physician Training and Adoption
- **Training Program:** Comprehensive program including hands-on sessions and certification
- **Change Management:** Physician champions identified in each department
- **Adoption Strategy:** Phased rollout with parallel human-AI decision making initially
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Regular surveys and adjustment based on physician input

**Action Items:**
- Develop training curriculum (Medical Education Team)
- Identify and train physician champions (Department Chiefs)

### 4. Implementation Timeline and Risks
- **Phase 1 (Q4 2025):** Pilot in one department with full evaluation
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** Rollout to additional departments
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Enterprise-wide deployment
- **Risks Identified:** Clinical validation challenges, integration complexities, physician resistance

**Decision:** Approve phased implementation with robust evaluation metrics

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Clinical Validation:** Ongoing monitoring and adjustment based on real-world performance
- **Technical Issues:** Comprehensive testing and vendor support agreements
- **Adoption Challenges:** Change management program and physician engagement initiatives

## Next Steps
1. Finalize pilot department selection (Due: October 5)
2. Complete vendor negotiations (Due: October 15)
3. Begin physician training program (Due: November 1)
4. Launch pilot implementation (Target: December 1)

## Outstanding Questions
- Long-term cost implications and ROI tracking
- Integration with telemedicine platforms
- Scalability to additional diagnostic specialties
