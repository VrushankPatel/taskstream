# AI Diagnostics Implementation Kickoff Meeting

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
**Location:** Conference Room A, Medical Center
**Attendees:**
- Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Medical Officer
- Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Radiology Department Chair
- Lisa Thompson, IT Director
- Robert Kim, AI Ethics Officer
- Jennifer Walsh, Patient Safety Coordinator
- External: Dr. Amanda Foster, AI Vendor Representative

## Meeting Objectives
- Review AI diagnostics pilot results
- Discuss full implementation timeline
- Address ethical and regulatory concerns
- Plan staff training program

## Key Discussion Points

### Pilot Results Review
Dr. Rodriguez presented findings from the 3-month radiology AI pilot:
- 94% accuracy in detecting abnormalities
- 35% reduction in radiologist reading time
- 12% increase in early cancer detection
- Minimal false positives (2.1%)

**Action Items:**
- Expand pilot to include cardiology and pathology departments
- Develop standardized reporting templates for AI-assisted diagnoses

### Ethical Considerations
Robert Kim raised concerns about algorithmic bias and transparency:
- Need for diverse training data sets
- Explainability requirements for AI recommendations
- Patient consent for AI-assisted care

**Decisions:**
- Form AI ethics review committee
- Implement bias monitoring protocols
- Develop patient information materials about AI use

### Implementation Timeline
Lisa Thompson outlined the technical rollout plan:
- Phase 1: Radiology full deployment (Q1 2026)
- Phase 2: Multi-department expansion (Q2-Q3 2026)
- Phase 3: Integration with EHR system (Q4 2026)

**Action Items:**
- Schedule vendor training sessions
- Procure additional hardware (20 VR headsets)
- Develop change management communication plan

### Staff Training Program
Jennifer Walsh proposed comprehensive training approach:
- Online modules for all clinical staff
- Hands-on workshops for radiologists
- Ongoing support and refresher courses

**Decisions:**
- Mandatory training completion by end of Q4 2025
- Create AI champion program for early adopters
- Establish feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Regulatory compliance:** Regular audits and documentation
- **Staff resistance:** Change management workshops and executive sponsorship
- **Technical issues:** 24/7 support team and backup systems
- **Patient privacy:** Enhanced data security protocols

## Next Steps
1. Finalize implementation budget (target: $2.8M)
2. Schedule department-specific planning meetings
3. Begin staff training program development
4. Establish AI performance monitoring dashboard

**Next Meeting:** November 5, 2025 - Implementation Planning Session
