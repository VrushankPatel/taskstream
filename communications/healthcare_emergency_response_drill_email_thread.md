**Date:** October 15, 2025  

Team,

As we approach the end of Q4, I wanted to provide an update on our annual emergency response drill scheduled for November 5th. This year's scenario will simulate a mass casualty incident involving 50 patients from a multi-vehicle accident on the nearby highway.

**Key Details:**
- **Date/Time:** November 5th, 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- **Scenario:** Multi-vehicle highway accident with 50 casualties
- **Focus Areas:** Triage protocols, inter-departmental coordination, communication systems
- **Participants:** All clinical staff, administration, security, and IT

Please ensure your teams review the emergency response protocols and complete the online training module by October 30th. We'll be testing our new patient tracking system integration with EMS this time.

Let me know if you need any additional resources or have questions about the drill procedures.

Best,  
Dr. Sarah Martinez

Sarah,

The surgery department is prepared for the drill. However, I'm concerned about the new patient tracking system. During last month's test, we experienced connectivity issues between the OR and ER systems. Can we schedule a walkthrough of the integration points before the drill?

Also, please confirm that we'll have adequate surgical staff available - the scenario mentions multiple trauma cases requiring immediate operative intervention.

Thanks,  
Dr. Michael Chen  
Chief of Surgery

Michael,

Good catch on the connectivity concerns. We've addressed the issues identified in the last test and added redundant communication channels. I'll schedule a technical walkthrough for next Tuesday at 2 PM in the command center.

To confirm: we now have three backup communication systems (primary wireless, secondary wired, tertiary satellite) and the patient tracking system has been upgraded to handle the increased load.

Sarah - please add this walkthrough to the preparation schedule.

**Additional Preparation Activities:**

Michael - confirmed that we'll have 8 surgical teams standing by, with additional staff on 30-minute recall.
