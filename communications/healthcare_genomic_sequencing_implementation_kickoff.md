## Meeting Notes: Healthcare Genomic Sequencing Implementation Kickoff

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Attendees:** Chief Medical Officer, Genetics Department Chair, IT Director, Compliance Officer, Laboratory Director, Clinical Informatics Lead
**Location:** Medical Center Conference Room

### Project Overview
CMO presented the strategic importance of genomic sequencing for precision medicine and personalized treatment plans.

### Current State Assessment
- Existing sequencing capacity: 500 samples/month
- Turnaround time: 2-3 weeks
- Clinical integration: Limited to research protocols
- Data management: Fragmented across multiple systems

### Implementation Objectives
- Increase sequencing capacity to 2,000 samples/month
- Reduce turnaround time to 72 hours
- Full clinical integration with EHR
- Comprehensive data privacy and security framework

### Technical Architecture
- Next-generation sequencing platforms
- AI-powered variant analysis and interpretation
- Cloud-based data storage with encryption
- Integration with clinical decision support systems

### Clinical Workflow Integration
- Ordering protocols for genomic testing
- Results interpretation and reporting
- Clinical decision support integration
- Physician training and education

### Data Privacy and Security
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Patient consent and authorization processes
- Data anonymization for research
- Audit trails and access controls

### Timeline and Milestones
**Phase 1 (Q4 2025):** Infrastructure setup and pilot testing
- Equipment procurement and installation
- Staff training and certification
- Initial clinical protocol development

**Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** Clinical integration and scaling
- EHR integration completion
- Full clinical workflow implementation
- Quality assurance program launch

**Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Optimization and expansion
