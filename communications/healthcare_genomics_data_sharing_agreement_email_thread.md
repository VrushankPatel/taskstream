## Email Thread: Healthcare Genomics Data Sharing Agreement

**Subject:** Draft Genomics Data Sharing Agreement with University Research Partners  

Team,

Following our discussion last week about expanding our genomic research collaborations, I've prepared a draft data sharing agreement with the University Medical Center for their oncology genomics study. The agreement covers:

1. Data access protocols for de-identified genomic sequences
2. Joint IP ownership for discoveries
3. Publication rights and attribution
4. Data security and privacy safeguards
5. Termination conditions

Please review the attached draft and let me know your feedback by COB Friday. We need to have this finalized before their IRB approval meeting next Tuesday.

Best,  
Sarah

Sarah,

Thanks for putting this together so quickly. I've reviewed the draft and have a few concerns:

1. The IP ownership section needs clarification on what constitutes a "discovery" - we should define minimum criteria for patentable inventions
2. The data security requirements seem overly restrictive for academic partners - we might need tiered access levels
3. We should include a provision for data quality validation before sharing

Can we schedule a call tomorrow to discuss these points? I want to make sure we're protecting our interests while enabling meaningful collaboration.

Michael

I've reviewed the draft agreement and support Michael's suggested changes. Additionally, I recommend:

1. Adding explicit GDPR compliance language for EU-based researchers
2. Including indemnification clauses for data breach scenarios
3. Specifying data retention and destruction protocols

The current draft is a good foundation but needs these legal safeguards. Let me know when you'd like to discuss the redline version.

Adding to Jennifer's points, we need to ensure:

1. Clear data minimization principles are applied
2. Audit logging requirements for all data access
3. Breach notification protocols within 24 hours
4. Annual privacy impact assessments

The University partners have good privacy practices, but we need to maintain our high standards for genomic data.

Thanks everyone for the thorough review. I've incorporated all the suggested changes into the revised draft attached. Key updates include:

- Detailed IP ownership criteria with examples
- Tiered data access levels based on researcher qualifications
- Enhanced security and privacy requirements
- GDPR compliance language
- Breach notification and indemnification clauses

This should address our concerns while maintaining collaborative intent. Please review the revision and let me know if we can move forward with the University partners.
