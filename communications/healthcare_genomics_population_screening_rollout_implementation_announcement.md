## Program Overview Implementation  

The Population Genomic Screening Program offers:  

### **Comprehensive Genetic Analysis**
- Screening for 150+ genetic conditions with clinical significance
- Analysis of carrier status for recessive genetic disorders
- Pharmacogenomic profiling for personalized medication guidance
- Hereditary cancer risk assessment

### **Preventive Healthcare Focus**
- Early detection of treatable conditions before symptoms appear
- Personalized prevention plans based on genetic risk factors
- Family planning support with carrier screening results
- Proactive health management for at-risk individuals

### **Accessible and Equitable Care**
- No-cost screening for eligible participants (ages 18+)
- Multilingual support and culturally competent care
- Remote consultation options for rural and underserved areas
- Integration with existing primary care services

## Implementation Details  

### **Eligibility and Enrollment**
- **Target Population**: Adults aged 18-65 with health insurance coverage
- **Enrollment Process**: Online registration through patient portal or in-person at participating clinics
- **Sample Collection**: Non-invasive cheek swab or blood draw at local collection centers
- **Timeline**: Initial rollout in 5 pilot regions, expanding nationally by Q2 2026

### **Clinical Workflow Integration**
