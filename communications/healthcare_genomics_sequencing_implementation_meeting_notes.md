## Healthcare Genomics Sequencing Implementation Kickoff Meeting

**Meeting Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Attendees:** Chief Medical Officer, Genomics Lab Director, Bioinformatics Director, IT Infrastructure Lead, Clinical Operations VP, Patient Experience Director  
**Location:** Medical Center Auditorium  

### Agenda
1. Genomics program strategic overview
2. Sequencing workflow implementation plan
3. Technology infrastructure requirements
4. Clinical integration and patient experience
5. Timeline and resource allocation

### Discussion Summary

**Strategic Overview**  
Chief Medical Officer emphasized the transformative potential: "Genomics sequencing will enable precision medicine for 50,000 patients annually, improving outcomes and reducing costs through targeted therapies."

**Workflow Implementation**  
Genomics Lab Director presented the 6-step sequencing workflow:
1. Patient consent and sample collection
2. DNA extraction and quality control
3. Library preparation and sequencing
4. Bioinformatics analysis and variant calling
5. Clinical interpretation and reporting
6. Genetic counseling and follow-up

**Technology Requirements**  
IT Infrastructure Lead outlined needs:
- Next-generation sequencing platforms ($5M)
- High-performance computing cluster ($10M)
- Secure cloud storage with HIPAA compliance ($3M)
- Bioinformatics software suite ($2M)

**Clinical Integration Challenges**  
Clinical Operations VP raised concerns:
- Physician training requirements for result interpretation
- Integration with existing EHR systems
- Turnaround time expectations (2 weeks target)
- Quality assurance and error rates

**Patient Experience Focus**  
Patient Experience Director stressed importance of:
- Clear communication about genomic testing
- Support for complex result discussions
- Privacy protection and consent management
- Access to genetic counseling services

**Implementation Timeline**  
12-month rollout plan:
- **Months 1-3:** Infrastructure deployment and staff training
- **Months 4-6:** Pilot program with 100 patients
- **Months 7-9:** Full clinical integration and optimization
- **Months 10-12:** Scale to full capacity and continuous improvement

**Resource Allocation**  
$25M total budget approved:
- Equipment and technology: $20M
- Staff training and development: $3M
- Patient education and support: $2M

**Success Metrics**
- 95% on-time result delivery
- 99% sequencing accuracy
- Physician satisfaction >85%
- Patient experience scores >90%

**Action Items**
1. Form implementation steering committee (All attendees, immediate)
2. Procure sequencing equipment and infrastructure (IT, due Oct 31)
3. Develop physician training program (Clinical Operations, due Nov 15)
4. Create patient education materials (Patient Experience, due Dec 1)
5. Establish quality monitoring dashboard (Genomics Lab, due Dec 15)

**Risk Mitigation**
- Technology failure contingency plans
- Staff recruitment and retention strategies
- Regulatory compliance monitoring
- Patient privacy and consent safeguards

**Next Meeting**  
Monthly progress reviews scheduled. First full team meeting October 15, 2025.
