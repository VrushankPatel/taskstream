**Subject:** Implementation Plan for Campus Mental Health Support Program

Team,

Following our strategic planning session last month, I'm pleased to share the implementation plan for our comprehensive mental health support program. This initiative addresses the growing need for mental health services among our patient population and staff.

**Key Components:**
1. **24/7 Crisis Hotline** - Launching next quarter with trained counselors
2. **Digital Mental Health Platform** - App-based CBT and mindfulness resources
3. **Staff Wellness Program** - Including peer support groups and EAP expansion
4. **Training Initiative** - Mental health first aid training for all clinical staff

**Timeline:**
- Q2: Platform development and staff training
- Q3: Pilot program launch with 500 users
- Q4: Full rollout and evaluation

**Budget Impact:** $850K initial investment with projected 3:1 ROI through reduced absenteeism and improved patient outcomes.

Please review the attached detailed implementation plan. I'd like to schedule a kickoff meeting next week to assign responsibilities.

Best,
Dr. Sarah Chen
Chief Medical Officer

Sarah,

The financial projections look solid. Can you provide more detail on the ROI calculation methodology? Also, how does this align with our current EAP vendor contract that expires in 6 months?

Thanks,
Michael

Michael,

Happy to provide the ROI details. The 3:1 ratio is based on:
- 20% reduction in staff absenteeism (conservative estimate based on industry benchmarks)
- 15% improvement in patient satisfaction scores
- Cost avoidance from crisis interventions

Regarding the EAP contract, this program will complement rather than replace our current vendor. We're planning to integrate their services into our digital platform.

I've attached the detailed financial model for your review.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

This is a critical initiative that our nursing staff has been advocating for. The 24/7 hotline will be particularly valuable for our night shift teams. Can we prioritize training for nursing leadership in the first phase?

Also, should we consider partnerships with local mental health organizations for additional resources?

Jennifer,

Absolutely - nursing leadership training is already prioritized in Phase 1. We'll start with a train-the-trainer model to maximize reach.

Great suggestion on partnerships. I've reached out to three local mental health nonprofits and am scheduling meetings next week. We could potentially leverage their expertise for our peer support program.

Let's discuss this further in the kickoff meeting.

Best,
Sarah
