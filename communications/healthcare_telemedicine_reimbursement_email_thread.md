## Email Thread: Telemedicine Reimbursement Policy Update

**From:** Sarah Johnson, Director of Revenue Cycle
**To:** Clinical Leadership Team, Billing Department
**Subject:** Urgent: Changes to Telemedicine Reimbursement Guidelines

Team,

Following the recent CMS updates to telemedicine reimbursement policies, I wanted to provide an immediate update on how this impacts our billing processes.

Key changes effective January 1:
- Audio-only visits now reimbursable at 85% of in-person rates
- Geographic restrictions lifted for certain specialties
- New modifiers required for remote patient monitoring

Our current billing system needs updates to accommodate these changes. I've scheduled an emergency meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss implementation.

Please review the attached CMS guidance document and come prepared with questions about your specific departments.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

Thank you for the heads up. This is actually positive news for our rural outreach program. The audio-only reimbursement will significantly improve access for our patients in underserved areas.

However, I'm concerned about the documentation requirements. Our providers are already stretched thin - we need to ensure the new workflows don't create additional administrative burden.

Can we discuss training requirements for the clinical staff during tomorrow's meeting?

Sarah and Michael,

I've reviewed the CMS guidelines and identified several system changes needed:
1. Modifier logic updates in our EHR
2. New claim forms for audio-only visits
3. Geographic validation rules removal

Our IT team estimates 3-4 weeks for implementation. In the interim, we should manually code these claims to avoid delays.

I recommend we prioritize high-volume specialties first. Cardiology and psychiatry will see the biggest impact.

Thanks for the quick responses, team.

Michael - you're right about the documentation concerns. We'll need to balance compliance with efficiency. Perhaps we can develop standardized templates.

Jennifer - good analysis. Let's plan for a phased rollout:
- Week 1: High-priority specialties with manual processes
- Weeks 2-3: System updates and testing
- Week 4: Full implementation and training

I'll send a meeting invite for tomorrow. Please prepare any specific concerns from your areas.

Sarah
