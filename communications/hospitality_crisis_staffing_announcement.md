Jennifer,

Operations team supports this activation. We've reviewed staffing levels across all properties and identified potential gaps in 3 locations.

**Additional Operational Measures:**
- Generator testing completed at all properties

- Guest room availability adjusted for potential staff accommodations

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Cross-training of staff for critical functions
2. Establishment of command center at each property
3. Regular status updates every 4 hours during the event

Let's coordinate a conference call at 4 PM to finalize property-specific plans.
