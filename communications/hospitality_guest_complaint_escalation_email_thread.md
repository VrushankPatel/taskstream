Team,

Received a formal complaint from Mr. Johnson in Suite 1205 regarding room service order delayed by 45 minutes. Guest was attending a business dinner and missed appetizers. He has requested a full refund of his $85 room service bill plus a $50 credit for future stay.

I've already apologized personally and comped the room service. Please review the attached incident report and advise on additional compensation.

Sarah,

Thank you for the quick response. I've reviewed the incident report. The delay was due to understaffing in the kitchen during peak hours. This is unacceptable for our luxury brand.

Actions taken:
1. Immediate apology and full refund issued
2. $100 dining credit applied to guest folio
3. Complimentary breakfast for tomorrow included

Please ensure the guest receives a personal follow-up call from me within the hour. Also, let's review kitchen staffing levels for evening shifts.

CC: General Manager for awareness.

Regards,

Team,

This incident highlights ongoing staffing challenges in food service. While the compensation is appropriate, we need to address root causes.

Immediate actions:
- Guest follow-up completed (Michael handled personally)
- Review kitchen staffing model for peak periods
- Training refresh on service standards for all F&B staff

Long-term: Schedule a full service quality review meeting for next week.

Let's maintain our 4.8/5 guest satisfaction rating.
