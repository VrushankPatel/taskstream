**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Attendees:** Guest Services Director, Front Office Manager, Housekeeping Supervisor, IT Manager, Legal Counsel  
**Facilitator:** Operations Manager  

### Agenda
1. Review recent guest complaint trends
2. Assess current escalation procedures
3. Identify improvement opportunities
4. Action items and timelines

### Key Discussion Points

**Complaint Trends Analysis:**
- 15% increase in complaints over Q3, primarily driven by post-pandemic service expectations
- Top issues: Room cleanliness (35%), Service delays (28%), Billing errors (20%), Noise complaints (12%), Amenities issues (5%)
- Average resolution time: 4.2 hours (target: 2 hours), with 68% resolved within 24 hours
- Guest satisfaction impact: Complaints correlate with 0.8 point drop in overall satisfaction scores
- Cost implications: Average $450 cost per unresolved complaint including lost revenue and compensation

**Current Process Gaps:**
- Inconsistent documentation across departments leading to information silos
- Lack of real-time escalation triggers causing delays in high-priority issues
- Limited guest follow-up protocols resulting in repeat complaints from same guests
- Insufficient training on complaint de-escalation techniques
- No standardized severity classification system

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Implement unified complaint logging system with mobile app access for all staff
- Create automated escalation rules based on complaint severity, guest status, and historical patterns
- Develop standardized guest communication templates with multi-language support
- Establish 24/7 complaint response team with dedicated escalation manager
- Integrate AI-powered sentiment analysis for proactive complaint identification
- Create comprehensive training program on conflict resolution and service recovery

**Risk Assessment:**
- Implementation timeline risks: Software integration may take 3-4 months longer than planned
- Staff adoption challenges: Resistance to new technology from long-tenured employees
- Cost overruns: Potential for 20% budget increase if customization requirements expand
- Guest experience disruption: Temporary service slowdowns during transition period

### Decisions Made
- Approve $150K investment in complaint management platform
- Pilot new process in 3 properties starting Q1 2026
- Create cross-departmental complaint resolution task force

### Action Items
- **Guest Services Director:** Draft new escalation procedures (Due: Oct 15)
- **IT Manager:** Evaluate complaint management software options (Due: Oct 31)
- **Front Office Manager:** Develop staff training program (Due: Nov 15)
