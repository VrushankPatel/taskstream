Team,

We had a serious incident this morning involving a guest in Room 1425 who experienced a medical emergency. The guest was transported to the hospital by ambulance and is currently stable.

**Incident Summary:**
- Guest reported chest pains at 7:15 AM
- Front desk called 911 immediately
- Hotel security and management responded within 2 minutes
- Guest transported at 7:22 AM
- Local hospital confirmed admission for observation

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- Secured the room and belongings
- Notified guest's emergency contact
- Prepared incident report for authorities
- Offered support services to accompanying family

This appears to be a legitimate medical emergency with no hotel negligence involved. However, we need to ensure our response protocols are followed perfectly.

**Required Follow-ups:**
1. Security: Review CCTV footage and update incident log
2. Front Office: Follow up with guest/family for wellbeing updates
3. Housekeeping: Deep clean room according to protocol
4. Communications: Prepare statement if media inquiries received

Please confirm completion of your assigned actions by end of day.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
General Manager
