## Email Thread: Hospitality Revenue Crisis Response

**From:** General Manager  
**To:** Executive Team, Department Heads  
**Subject:** URGENT: Revenue Crisis Response Plan - 30% Occupancy Drop  

Team,

Following our emergency leadership meeting this morning, I need to activate our crisis response protocol immediately. Our occupancy has dropped 30% this quarter due to the regional economic downturn, and we project further declines without intervention.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Revenue Management: Implement dynamic pricing with 15% discount for advance bookings
2. Sales Team: Contact all corporate accounts for rate negotiations
3. Marketing: Launch targeted local promotion campaign within 48 hours
4. Operations: Reduce overtime and implement energy conservation measures

Please confirm your department's action plan by EOD today. We'll reconvene tomorrow at 9 AM to review progress.

Best,

Sarah,

Revenue team has analyzed the current booking patterns. We're seeing particular weakness in our mid-week business travel segment. 

**Our Response Plan:**
- Dynamic pricing model activated: Base rates reduced 15-20% for Tue-Thu nights
- Corporate rate program: Offering 10% discount for 6-month contracts
- Local partnership program: 25% off for city employee bookings

We can implement this within 24 hours pending your approval.

Sarah and Mike,

Sales team has reached out to our top 20 corporate accounts. Initial feedback is positive - three accounts have committed to increased booking volumes at negotiated rates.

**Additional Opportunities:**
- Partnership with local convention center for overflow business
- Group rate incentives for community organizations
- Extended stay discounts for relocation clients

We'll follow up with detailed proposals by end of week.

Thank you for the quick responses. The plans look solid. Let's move forward with implementation immediately.

**Approved Actions:**
- Revenue Management: Proceed with dynamic pricing
- Sales: Continue corporate outreach with proposed incentives
- Marketing: Launch local campaign by Friday
- Operations: Begin cost containment measures

We'll monitor KPIs weekly: occupancy rate, average daily rate, and revenue per available room. Next check-in meeting: Friday 2 PM.

Stay focused - we can turn this around together.

Best,  
Sarah
