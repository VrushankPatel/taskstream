**Subject:** Critical: Severe Staffing Shortage - Peak Season Impact  

The regional labor market conditions have created unprecedented staffing challenges. We're currently 25% below optimal staffing levels across all departments.

**Current Situation:**
- Front desk: 6 vacancies (30% shortfall)
- Housekeeping: 12 vacancies (40% shortfall)
- Food & Beverage: 8 vacancies (25% shortfall)
- Impact: Service quality degradation, guest complaints increasing 40%

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. **Recruitment Acceleration:** Launch emergency hiring campaign with increased incentives
2. **Temporary Staffing:** Engage staffing agencies for immediate coverage
3. **Cross-Training:** Implement staff cross-training to cover critical positions
4. **Guest Communication:** Prepare messaging about potential service adjustments

This is unacceptable. We're in the heart of our peak revenue season.

**Approved Emergency Measures:**
- $50K emergency budget for recruitment incentives
- Temporary staff rate increase to $25/hour
- Mandatory overtime policy for essential staff
- Guest experience standards adjustment during transition

We cannot let this impact our 4.8-star rating. Daily updates required.
