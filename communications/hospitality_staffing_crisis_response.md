**From:** Human Resources Director
**To:** Executive Team, Department Heads, Property Managers
**Subject:** Critical: Peak Season Staffing Shortage - Immediate Action Plan

Colleagues,

We're facing a significant staffing challenge across our hotel portfolio as peak season demand exceeds our current workforce capacity by 25%. This is driven by industry-wide labor shortages and increased travel demand.

**Current Situation:**
- 40% of positions unfilled across front desk, housekeeping, and food service
- Guest satisfaction scores dropping 15% in affected properties
- Revenue impact estimated at $1.8M for Q3

**Immediate Response Plan:**
1. Activate emergency staffing protocols
2. Implement cross-training programs
3. Deploy temporary staffing solutions
4. Adjust service standards temporarily

Please review your department's staffing status and respond with specific needs.

Best,
Maria Gonzalez
Human Resources Director
