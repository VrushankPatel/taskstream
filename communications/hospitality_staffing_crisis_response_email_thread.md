As we approach our peak holiday season, we're facing a critical staffing shortage across all departments. Current projections show we're short 45 positions, primarily in housekeeping and food service.

Key challenges:

- Increased guest expectations during holidays

We need immediate action plans from each department. Please respond by EOD with:
1. Current staffing gaps
2. Recruitment strategies
3. Cross-training opportunities
4. Technology solutions to reduce workload
