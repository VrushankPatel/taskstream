Team,

With peak season approaching, we're projecting a 25% staffing shortfall across all properties. Current recruitment efforts have filled only 60% of open positions.

Immediate actions needed:
1. Cross-training current staff for multiple roles
2. Temporary staffing agency partnerships
3. Wage premium for peak season positions
4. Streamlined onboarding process

Please respond by EOD with your department's specific needs and proposed solutions.

Housekeeping shortage of 28 positions. Challenges:

2. Develop rapid training program (2 days vs 1 week)
3. Partner with local workforce development programs
4. Implement team-based room cleaning protocols
