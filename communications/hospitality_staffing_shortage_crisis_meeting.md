**Meeting Objective:**
Develop immediate and long-term strategies to address staffing shortages affecting 15 properties, with 200+ open positions and declining service quality.

**Current Situation Summary (Presented by COO):**
- 220 open positions across housekeeping, food service, and front desk
- Turnover rate increased 35% YoY due to competitive labor market

2. **Geographic Distribution:** Shortages most acute in urban properties
3. **Skill Gaps:** Difficulty finding qualified candidates for specialized roles
4. **Retention Issues:** Current employees considering external opportunities

**Immediate Actions Approved (0-3 Months):**

2. **Recruitment Acceleration:** Partner with 3 staffing agencies, launch targeted job fairs
3. **Retention Incentives:** Sign-on bonuses of $500-$1,000, referral program expansion
