Team,

Following the recent industry-wide staffing challenges, we've experienced a 25% reduction in available staff across all departments. This is impacting our service quality and operational efficiency.

Key impacts:
- Front desk coverage reduced to 60%
- Housekeeping completion rates at 75%
- Food service delays averaging 20 minutes

We need immediate action to maintain service standards. Please prepare department-specific contingency plans by COB tomorrow.

General Manager,

I've reviewed the current staffing data. Our turnover rate has increased 40% this quarter due to competitive offers from nearby properties.

Immediate recommendations:
1. Temporary wage increases for critical positions (15% premium)
2. Partnership with local staffing agencies
3. Cross-training existing staff for multiple roles
4. Retention bonuses for key employees

I'll coordinate with department heads to implement these measures. Budget approval needed for wage adjustments.

Adding to HR's recommendations, we should also consider:
- Simplified menu options to reduce preparation complexity
- Guest self-service stations for beverages
- Extended operating hours for remaining staff

This could help us maintain 80% of normal service levels with current staffing.

Thank you for the quick responses. Based on the input, here's our action plan:

1. **HR Director:** Implement 15% wage premium for front desk and housekeeping - effective immediately
2. **All Department Heads:** Cross-training program starts tomorrow, 4 hours per employee
3. **Food & Beverage Manager:** Roll out simplified menu and self-service options by Friday
4. **Operations Manager:** Coordinate with staffing agencies for temporary help

We'll reconvene next week to assess effectiveness. Customer communication about potential delays will be handled through our standard protocols.

Please execute these actions immediately.
