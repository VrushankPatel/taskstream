Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the comprehensive wellness program announcement. I'm particularly interested in the mental health counseling benefit - can you provide more details on the coverage limits and what types of providers are included in the network?

Also, regarding the flexible PTO, does this include the existing vacation time or is it additional days?

Best,  
Michael

Hi Michael,

Great questions! The mental health counseling provides 6 free sessions per year with licensed therapists through our EAP provider. This includes psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and marriage/family therapists. Sessions can be conducted virtually or in-person depending on provider availability.

Regarding flexible PTO, the wellness days are in addition to your existing vacation accrual. You'll have access to these additional days starting October 1st.

If anyone else has questions about the program details, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Best,  
Sarah

Sarah,

This looks like an excellent program! I'm glad to see the focus on financial wellness - that's often overlooked. Will there be any group workshops on topics like retirement planning or debt management?

Also, I noticed the gym reimbursement is $50/month - is that per person or per household?

Thanks!  
Lisa

Hi Lisa,

Yes, we're planning quarterly group workshops on financial wellness topics including retirement planning, investment basics, and debt management strategies. The first workshop is scheduled for October 15th.

The gym reimbursement is $50 per month per employee, regardless of household status. We want to make it accessible for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you at the wellness fair!

Best,  
Sarah
