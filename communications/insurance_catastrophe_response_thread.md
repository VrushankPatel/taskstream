Team,

Hurricane Zeta has made landfall with catastrophic damage across 3 states. We're activating our catastrophe response protocol. Initial damage assessments indicate 15,000+ potential claims with estimated losses exceeding $2B.

Immediate actions required:
1. Deploy mobile claims units to affected areas
2. Activate emergency call center protocols
3. Coordinate with emergency services for access
4. Implement expedited claims processing workflows

I've attached the full response plan. We need to mobilize within 24 hours.

Claims leadership - please confirm your team's readiness and resource needs.

This will test our catastrophe preparedness - let's execute flawlessly.

Mark,

Field teams are mobilizing. We have 50 adjusters ready for deployment and have secured 20 mobile units. Logistics are coordinated with FEMA for access to affected zones.

Challenge: Limited internet/cell service in hardest hit areas. We'll need satellite comms backup.

Requesting approval for emergency overtime budget of $500K.

Mark,

IT systems are holding under the surge. We've activated backup data centers and increased call center capacity by 300%.

Issue: Claims portal experiencing high traffic - implementing queue management.

We'll have satellite internet terminals deployed to field teams within 48 hours.

Excellent coordination everyone. Approving the overtime budget, Jennifer.

Robert - prioritize the satellite comms for field teams. This is critical for rapid assessment.

First 24 hours stats: 2,300 claims filed, 85% processed within 4 hours. Good start.

Let's maintain this momentum. Daily updates at 8 AM.
