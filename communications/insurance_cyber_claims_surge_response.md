**Subject:** Critical: Surge in Cyber Claims - Emergency Response Protocol Activated

Team,

We're experiencing an unprecedented surge in cyber insurance claims following the recent global ransomware attacks. Our claims volume has increased 300% in the last 48 hours, with $450M in potential exposure.

**Current Situation:**
- 127 new claims filed since Friday
- Average claim size: $3.5M (up from $800K normal)
- Response time target: 24 hours (currently averaging 72 hours)
- Staff utilization: 95% (claims handlers working 12-hour shifts)

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Activate surge response team and overtime protocols
2. Prioritize high-value claims (> $5M exposure)
3. Implement expedited assessment procedures
4. Prepare customer communications about delays

Please confirm your team's readiness and resource needs by 10 AM.

Robert,

This surge aligns with the parametric cyber products we launched last quarter. The automated triggers are working, but our manual assessment bottleneck is the issue.

Questions:
1. Should we temporarily suspend new policy applications?
2. Can we increase deductibles for renewal policies?
3. What's the reinsurance coverage status?

We need to protect our balance sheet while maintaining customer relationships.

Adding to the resource challenge - our forensic investigation team is at capacity. We're seeing sophisticated attacks requiring extensive analysis.

**Technical Challenges:**
- Encrypted data recovery demands specialized expertise
- Supply chain attacks require vendor coordination
- Regulatory reporting requirements are overwhelming

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Partner with external forensic firms (estimated cost: $500K)
- Implement AI-assisted triage for low-complexity claims
- Temporary hiring of cybersecurity consultants

We can scale investigation capacity by 50% within 48 hours with external partners.

Customer communications are critical here. We're receiving complaints about response times and uncertainty.

**Communication Strategy:**
- Proactive delay notifications to all policyholders
- Daily status updates via customer portal
- Media statement about our preparedness and response capabilities
- Industry association coordination for consistent messaging

We should prepare for potential reputational impact if delays extend beyond 1 week.
