**Subject:** Urgent: Surge in Cyber Insurance Claims - Response Plan Required

Team,

We've seen a 300% increase in cyber insurance claims over the past 48 hours, primarily related to the global ransomware attack affecting multiple industries. Our current processing capacity is at 150% utilization.

Key issues:
- 45 new claims filed since yesterday
- Average claim value: $2.8M
- Processing backlog growing by 20 claims daily
- Customer dissatisfaction rising due to delays

We need immediate action to:
1. Scale up claims processing team
2. Implement automated triage system
3. Communicate with affected policyholders
4. Review coverage limits and exclusions

Please advise on resource allocation and priority actions.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Claims Operations Director

Sarah,

This is critical. We've committed to our customers that we'd respond within 24 hours. Let's mobilize immediately.

Actions:
1. Activate emergency response protocol - bring in 15 additional adjusters from other departments
2. Deploy the AI triage system we tested last quarter
3. Send holding communications to all affected customers within 2 hours
4. Schedule emergency leadership meeting at 14:00 today

IT - please ensure systems can handle the load.
Underwriting - review coverage for these scenarios.

We'll get through this together.

Michael,

IT systems are holding up well. We've increased server capacity by 200% and activated backup processing nodes. The AI triage system is online and processing claims at 3x normal speed.

One concern: We're seeing increased phishing attempts targeting our claims portal. I've deployed additional security measures.

Ready for the emergency meeting.

Reviewing the claims, most fall within standard cyber coverage. However, we've identified 8 cases requiring policy interpretation for supply chain liability extensions.

We'll prepare coverage memos for the emergency meeting.
