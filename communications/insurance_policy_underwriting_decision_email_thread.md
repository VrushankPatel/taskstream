- Building age: 15 years, recently renovated
- Requested coverage: $20M building, $5M contents
- Client: Established real estate investment firm with good payment history

Risk assessment shows moderate flood risk but strong mitigation measures in place. Requesting approval for standard rates with flood exclusion.

David,

I've completed the risk assessment. Findings:

Positive factors:
- Recent flood mitigation upgrades (levees, drainage)
- Excellent maintenance records
- Low crime area with good fire protection

Concerns:
- Historical flood events (3 minor incidents in 20 years)
- Basement parking increases potential water damage exposure

Recommendation: Approve with standard commercial rates plus 15% flood surcharge. Total premium: $185,000 annually.

Risk score: Medium (6.2/10)

Please advise if you need additional analysis.

Best,
