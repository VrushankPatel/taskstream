## Email Thread: Underwriting Decision Review

Team,  

I'm seeking guidance on a $50M commercial property insurance application. The property is a mixed-use development in a high-risk flood zone.  

Key details:  
- Location: Coastal area with 100-year flood risk  
- Construction: Recent renovation, meets current codes  
- Value: $50M (building) + $10M (contents)  
- Client: Established real estate investment firm  
- Requested coverage: Full property, business interruption, flood  

The flood risk is concerning - we've had claims in this area before. However, the client has invested in extensive flood mitigation measures.  

Should we:  
1. Decline due to flood risk  
2. Offer coverage with high deductible and exclusions  
3. Require additional flood insurance from NFIP  

Please review the attached risk assessment report.  

Best,  
Robert Kim

Robert,  

Good analysis. I reviewed the risk assessment. The mitigation measures are impressive - elevated foundations, flood barriers, backup generators.  

I recommend offering coverage with:  
- $2M flood deductible  
- Business interruption limit of 12 months  
- Annual premium: $1.2M  

This balances our risk appetite with market opportunity. Let's discuss in tomorrow's underwriting meeting.  

Regards,

Agreed with Jennifer's recommendation. The mitigation investments reduce our risk significantly.  

Robert, please prepare the quote with those terms. Also, include a requirement for annual risk assessments.  

This fits our strategy of writing quality commercial risks.  

Approved.
