Team,

Following the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) announcement of updated Solvency II requirements, I've prepared an implementation plan for our EU operations.

Key changes effective January 1, 2026:
1. Enhanced capital requirements for cyber risk exposures
2. New reporting standards for climate risk scenarios
3. Strengthened governance requirements for outsourcing

Implementation timeline:
- Phase 1 (Q4 2025): Impact assessment and gap analysis
- Phase 2 (Q1 2026): System updates and process changes
- Phase 3 (Q2 2026): Testing and validation

Please review the attached detailed implementation plan and provide feedback by September 20th.

Best regards,  
Sarah Chen  
Chief Compliance Officer

Sarah,

The plan looks comprehensive. A few concerns from underwriting:

1. The cyber risk capital requirements may impact our pricing strategy for tech sector clients
2. We'll need additional actuarial resources for climate scenario modeling
3. The 6-month timeline for Phase 1 seems aggressive given our current workload

Can we schedule a working session next week to discuss mitigation strategies?

Adding to Michael's points - the capital impact assessment shows potential €2.5M increase in required capital. This will affect our return on equity targets for 2026.

We should include a capital planning workstream in Phase 1.

Team,

This is a critical regulatory change that affects our EU market position. I've reviewed the plan and approve the overall approach.

Key decisions:
1. Extend Phase 1 to 8 weeks to accommodate impact assessment
2. Allocate €500K for additional actuarial and compliance resources
3. Schedule monthly executive updates starting October

Sarah, please update the plan with these changes and circulate by COB Friday.

Regards,
