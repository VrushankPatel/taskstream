Alexandra,

I've reviewed the submission. Strong account with excellent risk profile. Support the proposed terms with one modification.

**Recommendations:**
- Approve proposed coverage limits and premium
- Reduce deductible to $100K to maintain competitiveness
- Add cyber liability coverage option ($500K limit for $150K premium)
- Require updated property valuations every 3 years instead of annually

**Rationale:**
- Market analysis shows competitors offering lower deductibles
- Cyber risk is emerging concern in manufacturing sector
- Reduced valuation frequency balances risk management with administrative burden

Please incorporate these changes and prepare final quote.
