## Email Thread: Insurance Underwriting Decision - High-Risk Commercial Property

**From:** Senior Underwriter
**To:** Underwriting Team, Risk Assessment Lead
**Subject:** Underwriting Decision Required: Industrial Warehouse Complex - $2.5M Premium

Team,

We have a submission for a large industrial warehouse complex in a flood-prone area. The insured is requesting $50M coverage with comprehensive perils.

**Risk Details:**
- Location: Zone AE (100-year flood zone)
- Construction: 1980s building with minimal flood mitigation
- Value: $35M replacement cost
- Operations: Chemical storage facility
- Loss history: No claims in 15 years, but area has seen major flooding

**Pricing Analysis:**
- Standard rate: $1.2M annual premium
- Risk-adjusted: $2.5M (includes flood surcharge)
- Competitor quotes: $1.8M (we believe underpriced)

**Concerns:**
- Flood risk significantly elevated due to climate change
- Secondary perils (wind, hail) also increased
- Environmental liability from chemical storage
- Building condition requires upgrades

Recommend declining or offering with significant exclusions. Please review and provide input.

Rachel,

I've reviewed the submission. Risk assessment confirms elevated flood exposure. However, the insured has implemented some mitigation measures:

- Elevated storage platforms installed
- Backup generators for sump pumps
- Emergency response plan in place

**Recommendations:**
- Approve with $2.8M premium (10% above quote)
- Require annual flood certification
- Exclude flood damage above $5M per occurrence
- Add environmental liability rider

This balances our risk appetite with market competitiveness.

Michael Chen

- Exclusions: Flood damage above $3M, pollution liability
- Conditions: Annual risk assessment required, mitigation improvements due within 18 months

**Rationale:**

Please prepare quote and binding authority.

Approved.
