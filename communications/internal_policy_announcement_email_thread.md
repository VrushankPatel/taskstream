Mike,

Great questions. To clarify:

1. Current hybrid schedules remain in place, but employees can now opt for full remote if they choose. We'll maintain core collaboration hours (10 AM - 2 PM EST) for all teams.

2. Equipment reimbursement increases from $500 to $800 annually, and we'll add a one-time $300 home office setup stipend for new remote employees.

The Q&A sessions are scheduled for:
- Tuesday, Sept 26th: 11 AM EST
- Thursday, Sept 28th: 3 PM EST

Please register through the HR portal.

The sales team has some concerns about maintaining client relationships with increased remote work. Can we discuss how this will be addressed in the performance metrics?

Jennifer,

Valid concerns. We've updated the sales performance metrics to include virtual relationship-building activities and client engagement tracking. Travel policies remain unchanged, but we've added guidelines for virtual client meetings.

Let's schedule a separate call with sales leadership to discuss implementation details.

Best,
Sarah
