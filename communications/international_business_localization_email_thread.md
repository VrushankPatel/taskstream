Team,

Following our Q2 board meeting, we need to finalize our localization approach for European expansion. Current analysis shows 40% revenue potential in EU5 markets, but requires significant localization investment.

Key requirements identified:
- Language translation for 12 languages
- Local payment processing compliance
- Cultural adaptation of marketing materials
- Local hiring and operations setup

Budget estimate: €15M for Year 1. ROI projection: 3.2x within 24 months.

Please review attached strategy document and provide feedback by EOD Friday.

Strong support for localization investment. Our research shows 65% of European consumers prefer localized content. Key recommendations:

1. Prioritize German and French markets (60% of EU5 opportunity)
2. Invest in local influencer partnerships
3. Develop region-specific pricing models
4. Create localized customer support teams

Marketing budget allocation: €8M of the total.

Product side fully aligned. Technical requirements:
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- Local app store optimizations
- Currency and tax calculation integrations
- Multi-language UI framework implementation

Timeline: 6 months for core localization, 12 months for full feature parity.

Local market perspective: This is absolutely critical. Our pilot in Netherlands showed 3x conversion with localized approach. Concerns:

- Local regulatory variations (especially financial services)
- Competition from established local players
- Speed to market vs. perfect localization

Recommend starting with Netherlands/Germany beachhead.

Approved. €15M budget allocated. Key decisions:

1. Phase 1: Netherlands, Germany, France (Q3-Q4 launch)
2. Full localization approach, not just translation
3. Joint leadership between International and Product teams
4. Monthly progress reviews with board

Let's execute aggressively - this is our biggest growth opportunity.
