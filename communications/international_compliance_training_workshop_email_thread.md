**Subject:** Q4 International Compliance Training Workshop Series  

Team,

As we expand our operations across new international markets, we need to ensure all teams are fully trained on the latest compliance requirements. I'm organizing a series of workshops for Q4 covering key topics:

**Workshop Schedule:**
- October 15: GDPR and EU Data Protection (Virtual)
- October 22: Anti-Bribery and FCPA Compliance (Virtual)  
- November 5: International Trade Compliance (In-person, New York)
- November 12: Cultural Compliance and Business Ethics (Virtual)

Each session will include:
- Regulatory updates from our legal team
- Case studies from recent international implementations
- Interactive Q&A with compliance experts
- Certification requirements for key personnel

**Mandatory Attendance:** All regional managers, legal counsel, and business development teams must attend at least 3 of the 4 sessions.

Please confirm your availability and register through the HR training portal by October 1. We'll be tracking completion rates and this will factor into performance evaluations.

Let me know if you have specific regional compliance topics you'd like covered.

Best,  
Lisa

Lisa,

Thanks for organizing this comprehensive training series. For our Latin America region, we'd particularly benefit from additional focus on:

1. Local transfer pricing regulations
2. Regional anti-corruption frameworks (beyond FCPA)
3. Environmental compliance requirements in mining/energy sectors

Could we add a Latin America-specific session in November?

Adding to Carlos's points, our Asia Pacific teams would benefit from:

1. China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) deep dive
2. India's data localization requirements
3. ASEAN Economic Community compliance frameworks

A regional breakout session would be very valuable given the diverse regulatory landscapes.

Thanks Carlos and Priya for the excellent suggestions. I've updated the schedule to include:

**New Sessions:**
- November 19: Latin America Regional Compliance (Virtual)
- November 26: Asia Pacific Data Protection and Trade Compliance (Virtual)

These will be in addition to the core sessions. All regional managers should attend their region-specific session plus 2 core sessions.

Registration is now open for the expanded series. Let me know if you need any accommodations for time zones or language requirements.
