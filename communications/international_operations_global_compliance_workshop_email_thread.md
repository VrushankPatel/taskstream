Jennifer,

This workshop is timely given our Brazil expansion. Key challenges in Latin America:

1. **Political Instability:** Frequent regulatory changes with new administrations
2. **Corruption Perceptions:** High-risk environments requiring enhanced due diligence
3. **Currency Controls:** Complex foreign exchange regulations affecting operations
4. **Labor Laws:** Significant variations between countries with strong union influences

We need practical strategies for managing these volatile environments. Can we include a session on crisis management for compliance violations?

Jennifer,

Asia Pacific presents unique challenges:

1. **Data Localization:** China and India requiring local data storage
2. **Digital Currency Regulations:** Varying approaches to crypto and CBDC
3. **Supply Chain Compliance:** Complex vendor networks across multiple jurisdictions
4. **Cultural Business Practices:** Gift-giving and relationship-building expectations

We should discuss how to maintain global standards while respecting local business cultures. Time zone considerations for the workshop would be helpful.

Middle East/Africa compliance landscape:

1. **Sanctions Complexity:** Multiple overlapping sanctions regimes
2. **Islamic Finance Principles:** Sharia-compliant business practices
3. **Data Protection:** Emerging frameworks with limited enforcement history
4. **Political Risk:** Geopolitical tensions affecting business operations

We need guidance on managing operations in sanctioned territories and engaging with local partners under restricted conditions.
