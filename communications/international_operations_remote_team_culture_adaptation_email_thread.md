I agree with the APAC director's points about regional customization. In Europe, we should focus on:

## European Considerations
- Direct communication styles and feedback cultures

- Data protection and privacy concerns in cross-border collaboration
- Multilingual communication challenges

## Integration Opportunities
- Leverage existing diversity and inclusion programs
- Connect with EU cultural competence frameworks
- Address Brexit-related cultural shifts
- Incorporate GDPR considerations in global data sharing

## Best Practices
- Include case studies from European cross-cultural projects
- Provide guidance on virtual team building in different time zones
- Address cultural differences in meeting etiquette
- Support development of cultural intelligence metrics

The framework looks comprehensive. Let's ensure the program is flexible enough to address regional nuances while maintaining global consistency.
