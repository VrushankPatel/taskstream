## Email Thread: Contract Negotiation Update

**From:** Senior Counsel  
**To:** CEO, General Counsel  
**Subject:** Q4 Vendor Contract Negotiations - Status Update  

Team,

Following our initial discussions with TechCorp last week, I've completed the first round of contract reviews. Key points:

- Pricing terms are within our target range of 15-20% below current rates
- Service level agreements need strengthening on uptime guarantees  
- Data protection clauses require updates to align with new GDPR requirements

I've scheduled a follow-up call for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Please let me know if you'd like to join or if I should handle this round.

Best,  
Sarah Johnson  
Senior Counsel

Sarah,

Good work on the initial review. Please include me on the Tuesday call - this is a critical vendor relationship.

Also, ensure we push hard on the uptime SLA. Last year's outages cost us $2M in lost revenue.

Thanks,  
Michael Chen  
CEO

Agreed on the call inclusion. Sarah, please prepare a negotiation strategy memo by Monday morning outlining our walk-away points and must-have terms.

Michael - I'll review the memo before the call to ensure legal compliance.

Regards,  
David Park  
General Counsel
