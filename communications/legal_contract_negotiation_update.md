Jennifer,

Good progress on the negotiations. From a financial perspective:

- The pricing is within our approved budget
- The payment terms are acceptable
- The SLAs provide adequate protection

On the indemnification, I agree we should hold firm. The broad language they're proposing is a non-starter.

For data ownership, we need to protect our analytics advantage. Let's push back on joint ownership.

The change of control terms seem reasonable with the cure period.

Let's get this across the finish line.

Jennifer,

From a sales perspective, this agreement is critical for our Q4 pipeline. The advanced analytics capabilities will give us a significant competitive advantage.

I support your recommendations on all three issues. The data ownership point is particularly important - we can't afford to give away our market intelligence.

The implementation timeline works well with our sales cycle.

Let's close this out.
