- Territory: Global, excluding China
- Term: 10 years with automatic renewal
- Minimum annual royalties: $2M

The deal includes cross-licensing of our machine learning patents. Legal review is complete.

Please confirm approval to proceed with signature.

Best,

Jennifer,

The terms look favorable. This gives us access to their proprietary algorithms while protecting our IP.

One concern: the China exclusion might limit our growth there. Can we negotiate that?

Good work Jennifer. The China point is valid but not a deal-breaker given our current market focus.

Let's move forward with signature. This positions us well for the AI market expansion.
