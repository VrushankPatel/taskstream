# Meeting Notes: Additive Manufacturing Quality Incident Review

**Meeting:** Quality Incident Review - 3D Printed Aerospace Component Failure
**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM
**Location:** Conference Room B
**Attendees:**
- John Smith, Quality Manager
- Maria Rodriguez, Production Manager
- David Chen, Materials Engineer
- Lisa Thompson, Design Engineer
- Robert Kim, Maintenance Supervisor
- Sarah Johnson, Supplier Quality Representative

## Incident Summary
On November 8th, a batch of 3D printed titanium aerospace brackets failed dimensional inspection. The parts measured 0.15mm outside tolerance specifications, resulting in rejection of 47 out of 50 parts produced.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Cause:** Material moisture absorption during storage. The titanium powder had been exposed to humid conditions (>30% RH) for 72 hours before printing.

**Contributing Factors:**
1. Storage container seal failure not detected during routine checks
2. Lack of real-time humidity monitoring in powder storage area
3. Insufficient training on material handling procedures for new technicians

## Immediate Actions Taken
- Quarantined remaining powder inventory (200kg)
- Implemented temporary manual humidity checks every 4 hours
- Recalibrated all 3D printers with fresh, verified powder
- Notified customer and arranged expedited replacement production

## Corrective Actions
1. **Short-term (2 weeks):**
   - Install automated humidity monitoring system in storage areas
   - Implement powder rotation protocol (FIFO - First In, First Out)
   - Add material moisture testing to pre-print checklist

2. **Medium-term (3 months):**
   - Upgrade storage containers with integrated environmental controls
   - Develop comprehensive material handling training program
   - Implement automated powder management system with RFID tracking

3. **Long-term (6 months):**
   - Partner with powder suppliers for improved packaging and quality certification
   - Research alternative drying technologies for moisture removal
   - Establish material quality laboratory for incoming inspection

## Financial Impact
- Direct costs: $45,000 (rejected parts, expedited replacement)
- Opportunity costs: $120,000 (delayed delivery penalties)
- Prevention investment: $85,000 (monitoring systems, training)

## Lessons Learned
- Material quality is as critical as machine calibration in additive manufacturing
- Automated monitoring systems provide better reliability than manual checks
- Cross-functional training between design, production, and quality teams is essential
- Early detection systems can prevent costly failures

## Action Items
- **John Smith:** Procure and install humidity monitoring system by November 30th
- **Maria Rodriguez:** Develop and implement material handling training by December 15th
- **David Chen:** Establish powder quality testing protocol by November 25th
- **Lisa Thompson:** Update design guidelines for moisture-sensitive materials by December 31st
- **Robert Kim:** Coordinate with maintenance team for storage area improvements by December 15th

**Next Review Meeting:** December 10th, 2:00 PM - Progress update on corrective actions

*Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM*
