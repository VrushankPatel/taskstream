This is an ambitious and important initiative. The procurement team has some immediate questions:

1. How will we prioritize suppliers for the partnership program?
2. What are the specific requirements for supplier participation?
3. How will we handle suppliers who cannot meet circular economy standards?

We're eager to get started but need clarity on these operational aspects.

Great questions - let's address them:

1. **Supplier Prioritization:** We'll use a tiered approach based on spend volume, strategic importance, and current sustainability performance. High-volume suppliers get priority for initial partnerships.

2. **Participation Requirements:** Suppliers must commit to material traceability, provide take-back programs, and achieve specific sustainability metrics. We'll provide detailed requirements document next week.

3. **Non-compliant Suppliers:** We'll work with a transition period and provide support for capability building. For critical suppliers, we'll co-invest in solutions. As a last resort, we'll consider supplier diversification.

Let's schedule a supplier workshop next month to discuss implementation details.

As a long-term supplier partner, we're excited about this initiative. However, we're concerned about the investment required for our operations. Can you provide more details on the supplier support programs and potential incentives?

We're committed to sustainability but need to understand the business case for our company.
