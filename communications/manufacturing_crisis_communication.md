**Subject:** URGENT: Plant Outage - Production Impact and Recovery Plan

Team,

I need to inform you of a critical situation at our primary manufacturing facility. At 2:15 AM this morning, we experienced a complete power failure affecting the entire production line. Initial assessment indicates this was caused by a transformer failure in the main electrical substation.

**Current Status:**
- All production lines offline
- Estimated downtime: 48-72 hours for initial repairs
- Impact: 100% of current production orders delayed
- Safety: All personnel evacuated safely, no injuries reported

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- Emergency response team activated
- Backup generator partially operational (50% capacity)
- External electrical contractors engaged
- Customer service team notified to manage communications

**Recovery Timeline:**
- Phase 1 (24 hours): Emergency repairs and safety inspections
- Phase 2 (48 hours): Full power restoration and system testing
- Phase 3 (72 hours): Production ramp-up and quality checks

We are working around the clock to minimize impact. I'll provide hourly updates.
