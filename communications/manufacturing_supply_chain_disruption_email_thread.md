**Subject:** Urgent: Critical Supplier Disruption - Immediate Action Required

**Date:** September 29, 2025 08:30 AM

Team,

I've just received notification from our primary semiconductor supplier that they're experiencing a major production disruption due to a fire at their fabrication facility. This affects 40% of our chip supply for the next 8-12 weeks.

Key impacts:
- Production halt on 3 assembly lines starting Monday
- Potential delay of 15,000 units in Q4 shipments
- Customer delivery commitments at risk

Immediate actions needed:
1. Activate secondary suppliers and assess capacity
2. Review inventory buffers for critical components
3. Prepare customer communication plan
4. Assess alternative sourcing options

Please respond with your team's assessment and recommendations by EOD today. We'll have an emergency meeting at 2 PM.

Best,
Robert Chen
VP Supply Chain

Robert,

This is concerning. Our secondary supplier can provide 60% of the affected volume but at 25% premium pricing. I've already reached out to them for confirmation.

Inventory assessment shows we have 3 weeks of buffer for most components, but the high-demand chips are critical.

Recommendations:
- Immediate allocation of secondary supplier capacity
- Expedited air freight for 2 weeks of supply ($500K cost)
- Customer notification with revised delivery dates
- Engineering review for component substitution options

Adding to Sarah's assessment - we've identified potential production bottlenecks if this extends beyond 6 weeks. Our line efficiency could drop 35% without these components.

Engineering is reviewing alternative component specifications that could work with minimal redesign. Preliminary assessment shows 70% compatibility.

We should also consider temporary production shifts to less affected product lines.

Customer impact assessment complete. This affects 12 major accounts with contracts totaling $8M in Q4 revenue.

Proposed communication plan:
- Immediate notification to affected customers with apology and assurance
- Revised delivery schedules with compensation options (discounts/credits)
- Daily status updates via dedicated portal
- Executive calls with key accounts

2. **Inventory Management:** Expedite air freight order for critical components
3. **Production Planning:** Michael to implement line reallocation starting Monday
4. **Customer Communication:** Jennifer to initiate customer notifications by 5 PM
5. **Engineering Review:** Complete component substitution analysis by Friday

Emergency meeting at 2 PM to finalize details. Let's turn this crisis into an opportunity to strengthen our supply chain resilience.

Robert and team,

I've reviewed the financial implications of this disruption. The $500K air freight cost is approved, and I've allocated an additional $200K contingency for expedited logistics.

For the secondary supplier premium pricing, we can absorb 15% increase without impacting margins, but anything above that needs executive approval.

Please keep me updated on the customer communications - we need to maintain relationships during this crisis.

Robert and team,

Excellent coordination on this crisis. I've approved the $500K air freight expenditure and the secondary supplier premium pricing. Keep me updated on the 2 PM meeting outcomes.

This disruption highlights the need for our supply chain diversification initiative. Let's use this as a catalyst for that program.

David
