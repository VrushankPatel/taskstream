The financial projections look solid with clear ROI. The $150M investment shows strong returns through cost savings and revenue growth. I've reviewed the supplier transition plan and the phased approach minimizes financial risk.

One note: ensure we have clear KPIs for measuring the sustainability benefits to support our reporting requirements.
