This is exactly what we've needed to compete effectively. The pilot results from our evaluation were impressive. I'm particularly excited about the predictive maintenance capabilities.

Questions:
1. When can we expect the first pilot line to go live?
2. What KPIs will be used to measure success?
3. How will supplier integration be handled?

Looking forward to getting started.

Thank you both for your supportive responses.

To address the Supply Chain Manager's questions:
1. Pilot line go-live targeted for December 2025
2. KPIs include uptime percentage, inventory accuracy, and on-time delivery rates
3. Supplier integration through secure API connections with training provided

The union's points about job security and retraining are already incorporated into our implementation plan.

Let's schedule a detailed kickoff meeting for next week.
