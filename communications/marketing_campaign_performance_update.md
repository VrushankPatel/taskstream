Sarah,

Strong start to the quarter! The lead quality looks particularly promising. VP Sales - can you validate the lead scoring on your end?

One question: Should we consider pausing the EMEA content syndication and reallocating budget to North America?

Let's schedule a quick sync tomorrow at 10 AM to discuss the recommendations.

Thanks,
Michael Chen
Chief Marketing Officer

Michael,

Lead quality is excellent - our team has already qualified 23 opportunities from this campaign, with an average deal size of $185K.

I agree with reallocating budget to North America. The EMEA market timing isn't aligning with our current capacity.

See you tomorrow.

Thanks for the feedback, Michael and David. I've implemented the budget reallocation and will monitor the impact over the next week.

**Action Items from Sync:**
- Increase North America LinkedIn spend by 25%
- Pause EMEA content syndication temporarily
- Launch targeted nurture campaign for high-intent leads
- Schedule weekly performance reviews moving forward

Will send Week 4 update next Friday.

Best,
