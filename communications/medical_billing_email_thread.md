## Email Thread: Medical Billing System Implementation Delay

**From:** Revenue Cycle Director
**To:** Executive Leadership Team
**Subject:** Urgent: Medical Billing System Go-Live Delay

Team,

I need to inform you of a critical delay in our medical billing system implementation. After extensive testing, we've identified significant integration issues with our EHR system that require additional development time.

**Key Issues Identified:**
- Patient demographic data synchronization failures
- Coding validation errors causing claim rejections
- HIPAA compliance gaps in data transmission

**Impact:**
- Current manual billing processes will continue for at least 6 weeks
- Potential revenue delay of $2.3M
- Increased administrative workload on billing staff

**Mitigation Plan:**
- Extended vendor support contract for accelerated fixes
- Temporary staffing augmentation
- Manual oversight procedures for critical claims

We apologize for this setback and are working around the clock to resolve these issues. I'll provide a detailed recovery plan in tomorrow's operations meeting.

Best,
Sarah Johnson
Revenue Cycle Director

Sarah,

This is concerning. Can you provide more details on the root cause analysis? We need to understand if this is a vendor issue or internal readiness problem.

Also, please include in your recovery plan:
- Timeline for resolution
- Additional costs incurred
- Risk mitigation for patient billing accuracy

We cannot afford billing errors that could lead to compliance issues.

Regards,
Michael Chen
CFO

Adding to Michael's concerns - the integration issues stem from API changes in our EHR upgrade last quarter. The vendor claims compatibility, but our testing shows otherwise.

I've escalated this to the vendor's executive team and requested an emergency fix deployment. We should have an update by EOD tomorrow.

Thank you for the transparency. Let's focus on patient care first - ensure no billing delays impact patient services.

Sarah, please coordinate with patient services to communicate any potential billing delays to patients proactively.

We'll discuss this in detail at tomorrow's executive meeting. In the meantime, keep me updated on the vendor response.
