## Meeting Notes: Major Donor Escalation Discussion

**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Attendees:** Executive Director, Development Director, Donor Relations Manager, Program Director  
**Subject:** Escalation of $500K donor complaint regarding program impact reporting  

### Discussion Summary

**Issue Overview:**  
Our largest individual donor expressed dissatisfaction with recent program impact reports, claiming that reported outcomes don't match their expectations for environmental conservation efforts.

**Key Points Raised:**
- Donor concerned about transparency in fund allocation, specifically questioning 15% administrative overhead
- Questions about measurable impact of conservation programs, citing lack of quantitative biodiversity metrics
- Requested more detailed reporting on specific initiatives, including GPS coordinates of protected areas
- Threatened to redirect future donations to competing organizations with "more accountable practices"

**Discussion Highlights:**
- **Executive Director:** "This donor represents 8% of our annual budget. We need to demonstrate immediate action and long-term commitment to transparency."
- **Development Director:** "Similar concerns have emerged from two other major donors in the past quarter. This may indicate a broader trend in donor expectations."
- **Program Director:** "Our current reporting focuses on outputs rather than outcomes. We need to shift to impact measurement frameworks."
- **Donor Relations Manager:** "The donor specifically mentioned social media criticism of our conservation efforts. Public perception is now a key risk factor."

**Action Items:**
1. **Development Director:** Schedule immediate call with donor to understand specific concerns and provide interim transparency measures (Due: Tomorrow)
2. **Program Director:** Prepare detailed impact report with metrics, case studies, and third-party verification (Due: End of week)
3. **Donor Relations Manager:** Review and update communication protocols for major donors, including quarterly impact updates (Due: Next week)
4. **Executive Director:** Develop enhanced reporting framework for all donors, including real-time impact dashboards (Due: Month end)
5. **Communications Team:** Prepare public statement addressing transparency concerns (Due: Next week)

**Resource Requirements:**
- Engage external audit firm for impact verification ($25K budget allocation)
- Hire part-time impact measurement specialist ($60K annual)
- Upgrade donor management software for automated reporting

**Follow-up Meeting:** October 5, 2025 to review donor call outcomes, impact report draft, and next steps.

**Risk Assessment:** Potential loss of $500K+ in annual donations if issue not resolved satisfactorily. Additional risk of reputational damage affecting other donors and grant applications.
