## Meeting Notes: Major Donor Escalation Discussion

**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Attendees:** Executive Director, Development Director, Donor Relations Manager, Program Director  
**Subject:** Escalation of $500K donor complaint regarding program impact reporting  

### Discussion Summary

**Issue Overview:**  
Our largest individual donor expressed dissatisfaction with recent program impact reports, claiming that reported outcomes don't match their expectations for environmental conservation efforts.

**Key Points Raised:**
- Donor concerned about transparency in fund allocation, specifically questioning 15% administrative overhead
- Questions about measurable impact of conservation programs, citing lack of quantitative biodiversity metrics
- Requested more detailed reporting on specific initiatives, including GPS coordinates of protected areas
- Threatened to redirect future donations to competing organizations with "more accountable practices"

**Discussion Highlights:**
- **Executive Director:** "This donor represents 8% of our annual budget. We need to demonstrate immediate action and long-term commitment to transparency. This is a critical relationship that could set precedent for our entire donor base."
- **Development Director:** "Similar concerns have emerged from two other major donors in the past quarter. This may indicate a broader trend in donor expectations around impact measurement and social accountability. We should proactively address this across all major relationships."
- **Program Director:** "Our current reporting focuses on outputs rather than outcomes. We need to shift to impact measurement frameworks using standardized metrics like hectares protected, species population changes, and carbon sequestration rates. This requires investment in monitoring technology."
- **Donor Relations Manager:** "The donor specifically mentioned social media criticism of our conservation efforts. Public perception is now a key risk factor. We need to enhance our digital presence and respond more actively to online conversations about our work."
- **Finance Director:** "Administrative overhead concerns are valid. We should prepare a detailed breakdown showing how the 15% covers essential functions like monitoring, compliance, and evaluation that directly support program impact."
- **Communications Director:** "This situation presents an opportunity to strengthen our brand as a transparent, accountable organization. We should turn this challenge into a demonstration of our commitment to donor partnership."
