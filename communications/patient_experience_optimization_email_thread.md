# Patient Experience Optimization Initiative

**From:** Dr. Jennifer Walsh, Chief Medical Officer
**To:** Patient Experience Committee (patient_experience@hospital.org)
**Subject:** Urgent: Patient Experience Optimization - Action Required
**Date:** October 10, 2025

Team,

Following our recent patient satisfaction survey results showing a 15% decline in overall experience scores, I've initiated an immediate optimization project. Our HCAHPS scores have dropped below the 75th percentile, putting us at risk for reimbursement penalties.

**Key Issues Identified:**
- 45-minute average wait times in emergency department
- 62% of patients report inadequate discharge instructions
- Communication breakdowns between care teams
- Limited access to patient portals and appointment scheduling

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Emergency Department process redesign - target 30-minute wait time
2. Standardized discharge protocol implementation
3. Care team communication training
4. Patient portal enhancement

Please prepare implementation plans for your areas by Friday. We'll reconvene Monday for detailed planning.

Best,
Dr. Jennifer Walsh
Chief Medical Officer
City General Hospital

Jennifer,

The nursing team is deeply concerned about these results. Our patient satisfaction scores have been declining steadily over the past 6 months. I agree with your priorities and want to add:

**Additional Nursing Priorities:**
- Nurse-to-patient ratio optimization
- Pain management protocol standardization
- Family communication improvement
- Post-discharge follow-up calls

We're seeing increased patient complaints about feeling "rushed" during interactions. I recommend we conduct staff focus groups to understand the root causes from the frontline perspective.

Jennifer and team,

From an IT perspective, we can significantly improve patient experience through technology enhancements. Our current patient portal has only 23% adoption rate, which is well below industry standards.

**Technology Solutions:**
1. **Mobile App Development:** Launch comprehensive patient app with appointment scheduling, test results, and secure messaging
2. **AI Chatbot:** 24/7 virtual assistant for common questions and triage
3. **Telemedicine Integration:** Seamless virtual visit scheduling and management
4. **Digital Wayfinding:** Indoor navigation system for wayfinding and appointment reminders

We have budget allocated for these initiatives and can accelerate the timeline. The mobile app could be in beta testing within 8 weeks.

Thank you all for the quick responses. I've compiled the patient feedback and want to share some key themes:

**Patient Feedback Themes:**
- "Staff seemed overwhelmed and rushed"
- "Confusing discharge instructions led to readmission"
- "Difficulty reaching care team after hours"
- "Long wait times without clear communication"

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement bedside shift report with patient participation
2. Create standardized patient education materials
3. Establish patient advisory council
4. Train all staff on empathy and communication skills

I recommend we form cross-functional workgroups for each priority area. I can coordinate the workgroups and track progress.

Thank you for the comprehensive responses. This is exactly the collaborative approach we need.

**Approved Action Plan:**
1. **Workgroup Formation:** Sarah will organize 4 workgroups (ED Flow, Discharge Process, Communication, Technology)
2. **Timeline:** 90-day sprint with weekly check-ins
3. **Budget:** $2.5M allocated from quality improvement funds
4. **Metrics:** Weekly tracking of key performance indicators
5. **Patient Involvement:** Include patient advisors in workgroup meetings

**Leadership Commitment:**
- Daily executive rounding in high-risk areas
- Monthly leadership walk-throughs
- Public commitment to patient experience improvement

Let's make this a success story. The board is watching closely.
