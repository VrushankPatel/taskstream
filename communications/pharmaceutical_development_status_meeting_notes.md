**Date:** 2025-09-25 14:00 - 15:30
**Location:** Virtual Meeting Room
**Attendees:** Dr. Sarah Mitchell (VP R&D), Dr. James Chen (Clinical Operations), Dr. Lisa Wong (Regulatory Affairs), Michael Torres (Project Management), Jennifer Kim (Finance)
**Facilitator:** Dr. Sarah Mitchell

### Agenda Items

#### 1. Pipeline Status Update (Dr. Mitchell)
- **Oncology Compound PX-47:** Phase 2 trial enrollment completed ahead of schedule. Interim analysis shows 68% response rate (target: 60%).
- **Cardiovascular Drug CV-112:** Phase 1 completed successfully. IND filing for Phase 2 submitted to FDA.
- **Neurology Treatment NT-89:** Pre-clinical studies 85% complete. Toxicology results expected next month.

#### Key Metrics Update
- Overall pipeline success rate: 82% (target: 80%)
- Average development timeline: 4.1 years (target: <4.3 years)
- R&D investment efficiency: $1.2M per active compound (target: <$1.5M)

#### Discussion Points
- PX-47 showing superior efficacy in biomarker analysis - potential for accelerated approval pathway
- CV-112 Phase 2 trial design optimized based on Phase 1 learnings
- NT-89 delayed by supplier issues for key excipient

#### Action Items
- Dr. Chen: Prepare accelerated approval briefing document for PX-47 by October 10
- Michael Torres: Coordinate with procurement for NT-89 excipient supply by October 5
- Dr. Wong: Schedule FDA meeting for CV-112 Phase 2 protocol discussion

#### 2. Regulatory Strategy Discussion (Dr. Wong)
- FDA breakthrough therapy designation application for PX-47 in progress
- EMA adaptive pathways program evaluation for CV-112
- China NMPA expedited review process for NT-89

#### Discussion Points
- Breakthrough designation could reduce approval time by 6-12 months
- Adaptive pathways allow mid-trial protocol adjustments
- China market represents 25% of global opportunity

#### Action Items
- Dr. Wong: Submit breakthrough designation application by October 15
- Dr. Mitchell: Evaluate China clinical development strategy

#### 3. Budget and Resource Allocation (Jennifer Kim)
- Q3 R&D spend: $42M (98% of budget)
- Projected Q4 spend: $48M
- Resource utilization: 92% across therapeutic areas

#### Discussion Points
- Oncology area over-allocated due to PX-47 acceleration
- Neurology under-resourced due to NT-89 delays
- Potential reallocation of $3M from oncology to neurology

#### Action Items
- Jennifer Kim: Prepare budget reallocation proposal by October 3
- Michael Torres: Assess resource needs for NT-89 acceleration

#### 4. Risk Management Review (Michael Torres)
- Clinical trial recruitment challenges in competitive indications
- Supply chain vulnerabilities for specialized compounds
- Regulatory pathway uncertainties in emerging markets

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Enhanced patient recruitment partnerships
- Diversified supplier base development
- Regulatory intelligence monitoring

### Next Steps
- Weekly pipeline dashboard updates
- Monthly cross-functional reviews
- Q4 strategic planning session: October 20

### Action Item Summary
