## Email Thread: FDA Inspection Preparation - Priority Actions Required

**Subject:** Urgent: FDA Inspection Preparation - Critical Findings from Mock Audit  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  

Team,

Following yesterday's mock FDA inspection, I've identified several critical compliance gaps that must be addressed immediately before our scheduled inspection in 3 weeks.

Key findings:
1. Incomplete batch record documentation in sterile manufacturing
2. Outdated SOPs for equipment calibration
3. Missing validation protocols for recent equipment upgrades

We need immediate action on these items. I've attached the full mock audit report.

Please confirm receipt and provide timelines for remediation.

Best,  
Dr. Emily Watson

Emily,

Thanks for the detailed report. Manufacturing team acknowledges the findings.

Action plan:
- Batch records: Complete documentation by EOD Friday
- Equipment calibration: Update SOPs by Monday
- Validation protocols: Draft by Wednesday, final by Friday

We'll need QA support for the validation work. Can you assign resources?

Mark,

Appreciate the quick response. QA will provide validation support - Sarah will lead.

Additional requirement: We need to prepare the inspection room and designate a scribe. Can manufacturing provide space in Building 3?

Also, please ensure all operators are trained on the new documentation standards.
