## Email Thread: Predictive Maintenance System Implementation

**From:** Operations Director

**Subject:** Urgent: Predictive Maintenance System - Implementation Status Update
**Date:** September 28, 2025

Team,

Following our meeting last week, I wanted to provide an update on the predictive maintenance system implementation. We're experiencing some delays that could impact our Q4 production targets.

Key issues identified:
1. Sensor calibration taking longer than expected
2. Integration with existing SCADA system more complex than anticipated
3. Training requirements for maintenance staff underestimated

Current status: 60% complete, but we're now projecting a 3-week delay to full deployment.

We need to decide whether to:
A) Push through with current timeline and risk incomplete implementation
B) Accept the delay and adjust production forecasts
C) Scale back scope to critical equipment only

Please review and let me know your recommendations by EOD tomorrow.

Best,
Operations Director

I agree with the assessment. The SCADA integration is the biggest bottleneck - we're dealing with legacy systems that weren't designed for IoT connectivity.

From IT perspective, I'd recommend option B. A rushed implementation could lead to data quality issues that undermine the whole system's value.

We could potentially accelerate by bringing in external integration specialists.

As the team that will use this daily, I strongly advocate for option C. Better to have a robust system for critical assets than a half-baked solution across everything.

We can prioritize the 5 most expensive-to-repair pieces of equipment first, which would cover 70% of our maintenance budget.

Thanks for the input. From a financial perspective:

- Option A: Highest risk, potential for cost overruns if issues arise post-implementation
- Option B: Acceptable delay, but impacts Q4 revenue projections by ~5%
- Option C: Most prudent approach, maintains budget while delivering value on critical assets

I recommend C, with a plan to expand once we prove the concept.

Let's discuss in tomorrow's operations meeting.

Agreed. We'll proceed with Option C - focused implementation on critical equipment. I'll update the project plan and production forecasts accordingly.

Thanks for the collaborative approach on this.
