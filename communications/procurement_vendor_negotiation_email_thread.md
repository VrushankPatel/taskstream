Dear [Vendor CEO],  

Following our detailed discussions and technical evaluations, I'm writing to outline our proposed contract terms for the enterprise software implementation. Our goal is to establish a mutually beneficial partnership that ensures long-term success for both organizations.  

Key points for discussion:  
1. **Pricing Structure**: 15% reduction from list price based on our volume commitment  
2. **Implementation Timeline**: 18-month rollout with phased deliverables  
3. **Service Level Agreements**: 99.9% uptime guarantee with defined penalties  
4. **Data Security**: SOC 2 Type II compliance and annual audits  
5. **Support Terms**: 24/7 technical support with 2-hour critical response  

Please review these terms and let us know your thoughts by October 22nd so we can schedule a negotiation call.  

Best regards,  
Procurement Manager
