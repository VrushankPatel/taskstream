## Email Thread: Product Launch Delay Announcement

**From:** Sarah Chen, VP Product  
**To:** Executive Leadership Team  
**Subject:** Q4 Product Launch Timeline Update  
**Date:** October 15, 2025  

Team,

After thorough review of our Q4 roadmap and resource allocation, I need to communicate an important update regarding our flagship product launch.

**Current Status:**  
Following the recent QA testing cycle, we've identified several critical issues that require additional development time. The engineering team has been working around the clock, but we've determined that rushing the launch would compromise product quality and customer experience.

**Revised Timeline:**  
- Original launch date: November 30, 2025  
- New launch date: January 15, 2026 (6-week delay)  

**Impact Assessment:**  
- Revenue impact: ~$2.1M delay in recognized revenue  
- Competitive positioning: Maintains our quality leadership  
- Customer communications: We'll proactively reach out to beta customers  

**Mitigation Plan:**  
1. Enhanced beta testing with select customers starting next week  
2. Accelerated post-launch feature development  
3. Increased marketing spend in Q1 to capitalize on launch momentum  

I understand this delay is disappointing, but I'm confident this decision positions us for long-term success. Let's discuss this in tomorrow's executive meeting.

Best,  
Sarah

Sarah,

Thanks for the proactive communication. I agree this is the right call - quality over speed. Let's focus on making the January launch exceptional.

Key priorities:  
1. Customer communication plan  
2. Internal alignment on new timeline  
3. Resource reallocation to accelerate post-launch features
