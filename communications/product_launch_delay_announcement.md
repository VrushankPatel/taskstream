## Email Thread: Product Launch Delay Announcement

Team,

After thorough review of our development progress and QA testing results, I need to communicate an important update regarding our Q4 product launch.

Following the recent discovery of critical performance issues during our final integration testing, the engineering team has identified that we need additional time to ensure the product meets our quality standards. The launch will be delayed by 3 weeks, moving from November 15th to December 6th.

Key reasons for the delay:
- Performance optimization requirements
- Additional security testing
- Enhanced user experience refinements

This delay will impact our Q4 revenue projections by approximately 15%, but we're confident this will result in a stronger product and better long-term customer satisfaction.

I've already coordinated with Sales and Marketing to adjust our messaging and expectations. We'll be providing additional training to the sales team on the enhanced features.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have concerns about this timeline change.

Best,
[Product Manager Name]

Thanks for the update and for catching these issues before launch. Quality first - better to delay than ship a subpar product.

Let's focus on making this launch exceptional. I've asked Finance to model the revenue impact and we'll discuss mitigation strategies in tomorrow's leadership meeting.

Understood. We'll adjust our Q4 forecasts accordingly. The additional features should actually help with longer-term deal closures.

Can we schedule a sales team briefing on the enhancements?

Absolutely, VP Sales. I'll schedule the sales briefing for next Tuesday. Let's turn this delay into a competitive advantage.
