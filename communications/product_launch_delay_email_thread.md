## Email Thread: Product Launch Delay

**From:** Product Manager
**To:** Leadership Team
**Subject:** Q3 Product Launch - Timeline Update

Team,

Following yesterday's QA review, I need to communicate a 3-week delay to our Q3 launch. The root cause is a critical bug in the user authentication flow that we discovered during final testing.

**Key Details:**
- Current launch date: October 15th
- Revised launch date: November 5th
- Impact: 3-week delay affecting revenue projections

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. Extended beta testing with select customers
2. Additional QA resources allocated
3. Marketing campaign adjusted to new timeline

**Business Impact:**
- Revenue delay: $250K
- Customer communication: Proactive notification planned
- Competitive positioning: Monitor competitor moves

Please let me know if you need additional details or want to discuss mitigation strategies.

Best,
Sarah Johnson
Product Manager

Sarah,

Thanks for the heads-up. Quality over speed is the right call here. Let's schedule a leadership meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss the full implications and ensure we're aligned on communication strategy.

Can you prepare a one-pager with the revised go-to-market plan?

Thanks,
Michael Chen
CEO

Adding to Michael's point - we need to model the financial impact more precisely. The $250K revenue delay figure seems conservative. Can we get updated projections by EOD today?

Also, any impact on Q4 budgeting?

Lisa Rodriguez

Michael and Lisa,

Attached is the updated go-to-market plan and revised financial projections. The revenue impact is now estimated at $320K, with Q4 showing a 15% uplift due to the stronger product.

Leadership meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM.

Best,
Sarah
