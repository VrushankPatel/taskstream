## Email Thread: Q4 Product Launch Timeline Update

**Subject:** Q4 Product Launch - Critical Timeline Update  
**Date:** October 15, 2025  

Team,

Following our QA review meeting yesterday, I need to communicate an important update to our Q4 product launch timeline. After thorough testing, we've identified several critical bugs in the user authentication module that require immediate attention.

Key issues identified:
- Session timeout handling inconsistent across platforms
- Two-factor authentication failing on mobile devices
- Security vulnerability in password reset flow

Our engineering team estimates 2-3 weeks to resolve these issues properly. This will push our launch from November 15th to December 6th.

Impact assessment:
- Sales team will need to adjust Q4 quotas and forecasting
- Marketing campaigns may require content updates
- Customer beta program participants will need communication

I'm scheduling a follow-up meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss mitigation strategies and reallocate resources. Please come prepared with any concerns or alternative approaches.

Best,  
Sarah Chen

Sarah,

This delay is concerning given our Q4 sales targets. We've already committed delivery dates to several key prospects based on the November 15th launch. Can we consider a phased rollout - launch core features first and follow with authentication fixes?

The sales team has 15 deals in the pipeline that are launch-dependent. A 3-week delay could cost us $2.3M in revenue.

Let's discuss alternatives in tomorrow's meeting.

I agree with Michael's concern about the revenue impact. However, releasing with known security vulnerabilities is not an option. We've already had one data breach this year, and another would be catastrophic.

Alternative proposal: Can we accelerate the fix by bringing in external security consultants? I've reached out to our preferred vendor and they could have a team here within 48 hours.

Thank you all for the quick responses and thoughtful alternatives. Security cannot be compromised - David is absolutely right.

Sarah, please work with David to explore the external consultant option. Michael, let's review the pipeline deals and see which ones we can salvage with the phased approach.

I'll expect a revised plan by COB tomorrow. Let's make this work.
