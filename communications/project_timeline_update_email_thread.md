# Email Thread: Q4 Product Development Timeline Update

**Subject:** Q4 Product Launch - Timeline Adjustment Required
**Date:** September 28, 2025

Team,

Following our sprint review yesterday, I've identified several dependencies that will impact our Q4 launch timeline. After consulting with engineering leads, we need to make a 3-week adjustment to ensure quality standards are met.

**Current Status:**
- Core features: 85% complete
- Integration testing: 60% complete
- Performance optimization: 40% complete

**Revised Timeline:**
- Beta release: November 15 (was November 1)
- Final release: December 6 (was November 22)
- Launch event: December 13

This adjustment prioritizes stability over speed. The additional time will allow for comprehensive testing and bug fixes that will prevent post-launch issues.

Please review your team's capacity for the next 3 weeks and let me know if you need additional resources.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

I support this timeline adjustment. The integration issues we discovered last week would have caused significant problems if we rushed to the original deadline. The extra time for performance testing is critical.

One concern: we'll need to bring in a contractor for the database optimization work. Current team bandwidth is at 110%.

Agreed on the timeline extension. Our automated test coverage needs to reach 90% before beta, and we're currently at 75%. The additional weeks will be crucial for comprehensive regression testing.

We'll need to prioritize the critical path items for the beta release.

Sarah,

Thanks for the proactive communication. Quality over speed is the right call here. The last thing we want is a rushed launch that damages our reputation.

Please prepare a communication plan for customers who were expecting the earlier timeline. We should frame this as "enhancing the product experience" rather than "delays."

Thanks everyone for the feedback and support. I've updated the project plan and will circulate it by EOD.

David - I'll draft customer communications emphasizing the quality improvements. Mike - approved the contractor request, HR will process today.

Let's make these next 3 weeks count.

Best,
Sarah
