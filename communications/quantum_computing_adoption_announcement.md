Team,

Following extensive evaluation and pilot testing, I'm pleased to announce our strategic commitment to quantum computing adoption. After careful analysis of the technology landscape and competitive positioning, we've decided to invest $50 million over the next three years in quantum computing infrastructure and capabilities.

**Key Decision Points:**
- Demonstrated quantum advantage in optimization problems relevant to our logistics and supply chain operations
- Strong partnerships established with leading quantum hardware providers
- Comprehensive talent development program to build internal quantum expertise

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Q4 2025: Infrastructure procurement and initial setup
- Q1 2026: Pilot deployment in logistics optimization
- Q2 2026: Expansion to drug discovery applications
- 2027: Full enterprise integration

**Expected Business Impact:**
- 15-20% improvement in logistics efficiency
- Accelerated innovation in computational chemistry
- New revenue streams from quantum-enabled services

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Phased approach to manage technology maturity risks
- Extensive training program for existing technical staff
- Close collaboration with academic partners for cutting-edge research

This represents a significant step forward in our technological capabilities and positions us at the forefront of quantum-enabled industries. I'll be scheduling individual meetings with each of you to discuss specific implications for your areas.

Best regards,
CTO

The financial modeling looks solid, but I want to ensure we have contingency plans for the high uncertainty around quantum hardware availability and pricing. Can we include sensitivity analysis showing best/worst case scenarios?

Also, please prepare detailed cash flow projections for the board meeting.
