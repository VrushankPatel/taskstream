**From:** Regional Property Manager

**Subject:** Urgent: Major Flood Damage at Downtown Portfolio - Immediate Response Required  

Team,

We have confirmed major flood damage affecting 12 properties in our downtown portfolio following last night's severe weather event. Initial assessment shows:

- 8 residential units with water damage (3-6 feet of flooding)
- 2 commercial spaces completely inundated
- Elevator systems compromised across 3 buildings
- Estimated immediate repair costs: $2.8M
- 45 tenants displaced requiring emergency relocation

Insurance claim filed - adjuster scheduled for tomorrow. Legal team, please prepare for potential liability claims from tenants.

We need immediate authorization for:
1. Emergency contractors ($500K budget)
2. Tenant relocation assistance ($200K)
3. Temporary housing arrangements
4. Communications plan for affected tenants

Please advise on next steps - this will impact our Q4 occupancy rates significantly.

Regards,  
Marcus Thompson
Regional Property Manager

Marcus,

Tenant feedback from initial communications:

- 85% expressed appreciation for quick response and relocation assistance
- 3 tenants requested additional support for displaced pets
- 2 commercial tenants concerned about business interruption insurance coordination
- Several residential tenants asking about temporary storage for belongings

I've arranged pet boarding services for affected tenants and am coordinating with insurance for business interruption claims.

Also, local news crews are requesting interviews - should we prepare a statement?

3. Legal exposure assessment (Sarah)
4. Tenant communication status (Lisa)

No media statements until we have full assessment. Crisis team meeting at 7 AM to prepare.

Marcus,

This is a major incident that will test our crisis response capabilities. The board has been notified and expects a full briefing tomorrow.

Approved emergency budgets as requested. Prioritize tenant safety and communications above all else.

Key priorities:
1. Ensure all tenants are safely relocated tonight
2. Document everything for insurance and legal purposes
3. Activate our crisis communications protocol
4. Coordinate with local authorities for any regulatory requirements

I'll be onsite tomorrow morning. Keep me updated hourly.

Marcus and team,

Legal assessment initiated. Key concerns:

1. **Tenant Communications**: All communications must be documented and approved by legal. No admissions of liability.
2. **Insurance Coordination**: Ensure adjuster has full access and documentation. We're invoking "prompt notice" provisions.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Check local flood ordinances and disclosure requirements for future sales.
4. **Contractor Liability**: All emergency contractors must sign hold-harmless agreements.

I've prepared template communications for tenants. Please route all external communications through legal for approval.

Potential exposure: $5-8M in tenant claims if we don't handle this properly.

Insurance response activated:

- Adjuster onsite tomorrow at 8 AM
- Preliminary coverage confirmed for flood damage under our enhanced policy
- Business interruption coverage triggered
- Temporary relocation expenses covered

Key actions needed:
1. Complete damage assessment documentation
2. Preserve damaged property (no cleanup until adjuster approves)
3. Compile repair estimates from licensed contractors
4. Document all tenant displacement costs

Expected settlement timeline: 4-6 weeks. We'll push for expedited handling given the scope.

- All tenants safely relocated to nearby hotels (42 rooms secured)

Weather forecast shows no additional precipitation expected. This gives us breathing room for assessment.
