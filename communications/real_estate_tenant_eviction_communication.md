## Email Thread: Commercial Tenant Eviction Notice

**From:** Property Manager  
**To:** Tenant Representative, Legal Counsel  
**Subject:** Notice of Lease Termination - Suite 1500  

Dear Mr. Johnson,

I am writing to formally notify you of the property owner's decision to terminate the lease agreement for Suite 1500 at 123 Business Plaza, effective 60 days from the date of this notice.

As discussed in our previous communications regarding the persistent late payments and lease violations, the property owner has determined that termination is necessary to protect the interests of the property and other tenants.

Please be advised of the following:
- Lease termination date: November 15, 2025
- Final rent payment due: October 31, 2025
- Property inspection scheduled: November 10, 2025
- Return of keys and access cards: November 15, 2025

We have arranged for a professional moving company to assist with the removal of your office furniture and equipment. Please contact them directly at (555) 123-4567 to schedule.

If you believe this termination is in error or wish to discuss settlement options, please contact me directly at your earliest convenience.

Regards,  
Sarah Mitchell  
Property Manager  
Metro Properties Management

Sarah,

This comes as a surprise given our recent discussions about payment arrangements. We have been current on rent for the past three months and have addressed the maintenance issues that were previously cited.

We respectfully request an extension of at least 90 days to locate suitable alternative premises and complete our relocation. Our business employs 25 people and an abrupt termination would cause significant disruption.

Please let us know if we can schedule a meeting to discuss this matter further.

Best regards,  
Michael Johnson

Michael,

Thank you for your response. While we acknowledge the recent improvements in payment history, the lease violations include multiple instances of unauthorized alterations to the premises and failure to maintain required insurance coverage.

The property owner has reviewed your request for extension but maintains the 60-day termination period as originally stated. However, we are willing to discuss a negotiated settlement that could include:

1. Immediate payment of all outstanding charges ($12,500)
2. Professional restoration of leasehold improvements to original condition
3. Agreement to vacate by the termination date

Please confirm your availability for a mediation session with our legal counsel next week.

Regards,  
Sarah Mitchell
