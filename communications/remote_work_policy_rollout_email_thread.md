Team,

After months of careful consideration and feedback from our employee survey, I'm pleased to announce that we've finalized our hybrid work policy. This policy reflects our commitment to flexibility while ensuring we maintain the collaboration and culture that makes our company special.

Key highlights:
- Flexible scheduling with core collaboration hours 10 AM - 2 PM
- Two days in-office requirement for most roles
- Enhanced technology support for remote work
- Updated performance management guidelines

Please review the full policy attached. We'll be holding information sessions next week to address questions.

Best,  
Sarah Johnson  
Chief People Officer

Sarah,

Thanks for the update. The engineering team has some concerns about the two-day in-office requirement. Our work often requires deep focus time that can be more productive remotely. Can we discuss role-specific exceptions?

Also, will there be any changes to our equipment stipend?

Regards,  
Mike Chen

Mike,

Great questions. We designed the policy with flexibility in mind. Department heads can approve exceptions for specific roles where remote work demonstrably improves productivity. Engineering is actually a good candidate for this - let's set up a call to discuss.

Regarding equipment: Yes, we're increasing the annual stipend from $500 to $1,000 to cover monitors, ergonomic furniture, and high-speed internet reimbursements.

Hi Sarah,

I appreciate the thought put into this policy. One question - how will performance be evaluated for remote vs in-office employees to ensure fairness?

Thanks,

Jamie,

Excellent question. Performance evaluations will continue to focus on deliverables, impact, and collaboration quality rather than physical presence. Managers will use the same criteria for all team members, with additional emphasis on proactive communication for remote workers.

We're also implementing new tools to track project progress and team interaction regardless of location.
