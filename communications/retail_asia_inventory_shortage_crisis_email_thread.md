**Subject:** Urgent: Critical Inventory Shortage in Electronics Category - Immediate Action Required

Team,

I've just been notified by our key electronics supplier that they're experiencing a major production disruption due to component shortages. This affects 40% of our Q4 electronics inventory, with potential impact of Â¥500M in lost sales.

Key issues:
- Main supplier offline for 3-4 weeks
- No immediate alternative suppliers available
- Peak holiday season starting in 6 weeks
- Customer orders already committed

We need to activate our crisis response protocol immediately. Please prepare contingency plans and alternative sourcing options.

Best,
Takeshi Nakamura
Supply Chain Director

Takeshi,

This is concerning. Our current inventory levels show we have 2 weeks coverage for affected SKUs. I've initiated contact with our secondary suppliers, but they're also impacted by the same component issues.

Immediate actions we're taking:
1. Pausing new customer orders for affected products
2. Reviewing existing orders for priority fulfillment
3. Exploring air freight options for critical components

Marketing team - we need to prepare customer communications about potential delays.

Customer Service - prepare for increased inquiry volume.

Let me know if you need additional resources.

Regards,
Mei Chen
Operations Manager

Understood. We're drafting customer communication templates now:

1. Order delay notifications for existing customers
2. Product page updates with availability warnings
3. Social media posts explaining the situation transparently

We're also exploring promotional alternatives for unaffected product categories to maintain revenue momentum.

Should we consider price adjustments for expedited shipping options?

Best,
Rajesh Kumar
Marketing Director

Team,

Customer service lines are already seeing increased calls about order status. We've deployed additional staff and updated our FAQ section.

Key concerns from customers:
- Refund policies for delayed orders
- Alternative product recommendations
- Communication about restocking timelines

We're coordinating with marketing on unified messaging.

Please keep us updated on supplier recovery timelines.

Thanks,
Li Wei
Customer Service Head

Thanks for the quick responses, team. Good coordination so far.

Update from supplier: Recovery timeline now estimated at 4-5 weeks due to additional regulatory approvals needed for alternative components.

Next steps:
1. Mei - Continue secondary supplier exploration, consider overseas options
2. Rajesh - Launch customer communications by EOD
3. Li Wei - Monitor customer sentiment and feedback
4. All - Daily crisis update calls at 9 AM starting tomorrow

We'll reconvene at 5 PM today for detailed action plan.
