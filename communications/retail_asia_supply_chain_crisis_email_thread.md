Team,

Following the recent container ship grounding in the South China Sea, we've conducted an initial impact assessment. Key findings:

- 40% of our Q3 electronics inventory delayed by 3-4 weeks
- Estimated revenue impact: $12M
- Customer orders affected: 25,000 units

Immediate actions needed:
1. Customer communication plan
2. Alternative sourcing evaluation
3. Inventory reallocation strategy

Please advise on priority actions.

Best,
Supply Chain Director

This is concerning. We need to minimize customer impact.

Action priorities:
1. Communicate transparently with affected customers - offer alternatives
2. Activate backup suppliers immediately
3. Consider air freight for critical items

Let's have an emergency meeting at 14:00 today to develop detailed response plan.

Agree with CEO's priorities. Customer communication template drafted - includes apology, explanation, and compensation options (store credit, expedited shipping).

Will prepare customer service team for increased call volume.

Financial impact assessment:
- Direct costs: $2M (air freight, expedited shipping)
- Opportunity costs: $10M (lost sales, customer churn)

Will prepare financial contingency plan for 14:00 meeting.
