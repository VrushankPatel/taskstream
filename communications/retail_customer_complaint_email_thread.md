Dear Mr. Doe,

Thank you for contacting RetailChain customer service regarding your recent order. I apologize for the inconvenience caused by receiving a damaged wireless headset.

I've reviewed your order details and can confirm the product was shipped from our warehouse in good condition. To resolve this quickly, I'd like to offer you a full refund of $149.99 plus a 20% discount on your next purchase.

Please let me know if this resolution works for you, or if you'd prefer an exchange instead.

Best regards,

Sarah,

The refund offer is appreciated, but this is the second time I've received damaged electronics from your company in 3 months. I need to speak with a manager about your quality control processes. This level of service is unacceptable for premium products.
