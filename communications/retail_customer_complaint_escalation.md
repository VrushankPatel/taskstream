## Email Thread: Retail Customer Complaint Escalation

**Subject:** Urgent: High-Value Customer Complaint - Escalation Required

Team,

I'm escalating a complaint from our top-tier loyalty customer, Ms. Johnson (annual spend: $45,000). She purchased a high-end appliance last week that arrived damaged, and our standard return process has not satisfied her.

**Customer Statement:** "This is unacceptable. I've been a loyal customer for 8 years and expect better service. The damaged product has disrupted my entire kitchen renovation project."

**Current Status:** Store team offered replacement, but customer demands full refund plus compensation for installation delays. She's threatening to post negative reviews across social media.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediate call from Regional Director to apologize personally
2. Full refund processed within 24 hours
3. $500 goodwill gesture for inconvenience
4. Follow-up satisfaction survey in 48 hours

Please advise on approval for the goodwill payment. Customer retention is critical here.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Customer Service Manager

Sarah,

I spoke with Ms. Johnson directly. She's extremely frustrated and mentioned she's considering switching to our competitor. I've authorized the full refund and $500 goodwill credit.

**Action Items:**
- Process refund immediately (Sarah)
- Issue $500 store credit (Store Manager)
- CEO to send personal apology email (I'll draft)
- Monitor social media for any posts

This customer represents 2% of store revenue. Let's turn this around.

Regards,
Michael Torres
Regional Operations Director
