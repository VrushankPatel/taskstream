## Email Thread: Customer Complaint Escalation - Damaged Product

**From:** Customer Service Supervisor
**To:** Store Operations Manager, Customer Experience Director
**Subject:** Urgent Escalation: Premium Customer Complaint - Order #RET-2025-04567

Team,

I'm escalating a critical customer complaint that requires immediate attention.

**Customer:** Jennifer Martinez (Gold Loyalty Member, 5-year history, $12K lifetime value)
**Order:** #RET-2025-04567 - Designer handbag ($450)
**Issue:** Product arrived with manufacturing defect (broken zipper) despite being listed as "new condition"
**Timeline:**
- Order placed: September 20
- Delivered: September 22
- Customer contacted support: September 23
- Initial response: September 24 (offered return label)
- Customer follow-up: September 25 (expressed dissatisfaction with process)

The customer is threatening to:
- Post negative reviews on social media
- Cancel loyalty membership
- Switch to competitor

Our current return policy requires the customer to ship the item back at their expense before we process refund, which is causing frustration.

**Requested Action:**
- Approve expedited replacement (send new item immediately)
- Full refund for original purchase
- Express shipping upgrade
- $100 goodwill credit
- Personal apology call from store manager

Please advise on resolution approach. This could impact our Net Promoter Score significantly.

Best regards,
Marcus Thompson

Marcus,

This is unacceptable. Gold members should never experience this level of service failure.

**Approved Resolution:**
1. Immediate replacement shipment (overnight, signature required)
2. Full refund processed today via original payment method
3. $150 store credit as compensation
4. Upgrade to Platinum membership status for 6 months
5. I'll personally call the customer within the hour

**Root Cause:** Our quality inspection process failed. I'll review the vendor's recent shipments and implement additional QC checks.

**Follow-up:** Please update our CRM with resolution details and schedule a customer satisfaction survey in 7 days.
