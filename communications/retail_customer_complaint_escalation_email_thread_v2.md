## Email Thread: Retail Customer Complaint Escalation

**From:** Customer Service Manager  
**To:** Store Manager, Regional Director  
**Subject:** Urgent: High-Value Customer Complaint - Escalation Required  

Team,

We received a complaint from our Platinum member, Ms. Johnson, regarding a defective product purchased last week. She's threatening to take her business elsewhere and has already posted negative reviews on social media.

Details:
- Order #12345 - Premium blender
- Issue: Motor failure after 3 uses
- Customer value: $15K annual spend
- Social media impact: 500+ views on review

I've offered a full refund and replacement, but she's demanding additional compensation. Please advise on next steps.

Best,  
Sarah Chen  
Customer Service Manager

Sarah,

This is concerning. The blender was from our premium line - we need to investigate the quality issue. I've pulled the batch from shelves.

For the customer, I recommend we offer:
- Full refund + replacement
- $100 gift card
- Priority shipping on future orders
- Personal follow-up call from me

Let's get this resolved quickly to protect our reputation.

Regards,  
Mike Torres

Thanks for the quick escalation. This aligns with our customer retention protocol.

Approved the compensation package. Mike, please handle the personal call today. Sarah, coordinate with social media team to respond to the review.

We'll review the product quality issue in tomorrow's operations meeting.

Keep me posted on resolution.

Best,
