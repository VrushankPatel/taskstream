**Subject:** URGENT: Supply Chain Disruption - Immediate Action Required

Team,

I've just received confirmation from our primary logistics provider that a major warehouse fire in Rotterdam has destroyed 40% of our Q4 inventory for electronics and home goods. This affects 12 stores across Benelux and will impact €2.8M in projected revenue.

Key impacts:
- Electronics category: 60% stock depletion
- Home goods: 45% stock depletion
- Estimated customer service disruption: 2-3 weeks
- Potential reputational damage from stockouts

We need immediate decisions on:
1. Alternative sourcing options (China suppliers activation - €500K budget allocation needed)
2. Customer communication strategy (loyalty program compensation, social media transparency)
3. Emergency inventory redistribution from other warehouses (logistics coordination required)
4. Temporary store closures vs. limited operations (impact assessment: 12 stores affected)
5. Insurance claim initiation for warehouse fire losses (€1.2M potential recovery)
6. Supplier relationship review and diversification strategy

Please advise on priority actions. Crisis management team meeting scheduled for 16:00 today.

Best,
Marcus
Supply Chain Director

Marcus,

This is critical. We cannot afford service disruptions during peak season. Immediate actions:

1. Activate emergency supplier contracts - authorize up to €500K for expedited shipping
2. Implement customer communication: "Temporary stock adjustments due to supply chain challenges - full refunds available"
3. Redistribute inventory from German and French warehouses overnight
4. No store closures - maintain skeleton operations with core products

I'll join the 16:00 meeting. CFO to prepare financial impact assessment.

Stay calm, execute decisively.

Regards,
Elena
CEO

Adding financial perspective:

- Immediate cost impact: €450K (emergency shipping + overtime)
- Revenue loss projection: €2.1M if unresolved in 2 weeks
- Mitigation options cost: €780K total
- Insurance claim: €1.2M potential recovery

Recommend proceeding with emergency measures. Will present detailed financials at 16:00.

Customer communication strategy ready:

- Social media posts explaining situation transparently
- Email campaign to loyalty program members with exclusive early access to restocked items
- In-store signage and staff training on customer messaging
- Press release prepared for major media outlets

This positions us as proactive and customer-focused rather than reactive.

Thank you all for the swift responses. Actions initiated:

- Emergency supplier contracts activated (€350K committed)

Will provide hourly updates. This is manageable with our contingency planning.

- Peak season impact: 12% revenue reduction mitigated to 8%
- Customer retention: Expected 95% with communication strategy
- Long-term opportunity: Strengthen supplier relationships and diversify sourcing
