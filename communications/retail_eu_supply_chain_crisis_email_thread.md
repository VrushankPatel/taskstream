Team,

We're experiencing significant supply chain disruptions across our European operations due to recent transportation strikes and customs delays. This is affecting 30% of our EU inventory flow.

Immediate priorities:

1. Activate alternative shipping routes

2. Contact local suppliers for emergency stock

3. Implement customer communication protocols

4. Monitor inventory levels closely

Please provide status updates on your regions by EOD today.

Best regards,
