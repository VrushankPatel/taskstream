Team,

Following the recent Suez Canal incident, we're facing significant delays in our Q2 container shipments from Asia. Current assessment shows:

- 40% of spring inventory delayed by 3-4 weeks
- Projected revenue impact: €12M shortfall
- Customer orders affected: 25,000 units

Immediate actions needed:
1. Activate contingency suppliers
2. Communicate with affected customers
3. Review pricing strategy for delayed items

Please advise on prioritization approach.

Best,
Marcus
Supply Chain Director
