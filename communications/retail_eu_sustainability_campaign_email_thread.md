Sarah,

This is excellent work. The "Green Tomorrow" campaign perfectly aligns with our EU Green Deal commitments and customer expectations. The comprehensive approach covering products, operations, and customer engagement is exactly what we need.

A few quick notes:
- Let's ensure we highlight the €12M sustainability investment announced last month
- Coordinate with our supplier partners for co-branding opportunities
- Include customer testimonials in the campaign materials

Looking forward to the kickoff meeting. This has the potential to significantly differentiate us in the market.

Best,

Great initiative, Sarah and Michael.

From a sustainability perspective, I want to ensure we have the metrics and tracking in place to measure real impact. I've attached our sustainability dashboard template that we can integrate into the campaign reporting.

Key data points we should track:
- Carbon emissions reduction (real-time tracking)
- Sustainable product sales conversion rates
- Waste diversion metrics
- Customer engagement with sustainability features

Let's discuss integration during the kickoff.

Sarah,

The campaign looks comprehensive. From operations, I want to flag that we'll need additional staff training for the new sustainable practices and in-store initiatives.

**Resource Requirements:**
- 2-week training program for all store staff (4,200 employees)
- Point-of-sale system updates for sustainable product tracking
- In-store display materials and signage

**Timeline Impact:**
- Training completion by March 15th to support campaign launch
- System updates by January 31st

Can we allocate budget for the training program? Current operations budget might be tight.

Thanks,  
Marcus Thompson  
Store Operations Director
