Robert,

This requires our full crisis response capabilities. I've authorized $750K emergency budget for alternative sourcing and customer remediation.

**Executive Priorities:**
- Customer Service: Activate delay communication templates and loyalty compensation
- Supply Chain: Secure alternative suppliers within 24 hours
- Stores: Implement visual merchandising adjustments for available products
- Marketing: Launch promotion campaigns for unaffected categories

We must protect customer trust and minimize revenue impact. Hourly updates required.
