**Subject:** Urgent: Inventory Shortage Response Plan  

Team,

Following supplier delays and increased demand, we've identified critical inventory shortages in key product categories.

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Inventory audit completed - 60% of SKUs have less than 2 weeks supply
2. Alternative suppliers identified for 40% of affected products
3. Customer communication plan drafted for potential delays

**Next Steps:**
- Daily inventory status updates starting tomorrow
- Customer notification for orders delayed beyond 24 hours
- Emergency procurement plan activation

Please review the attached response plan and let me know if you need additional resources.

Best,  
Sarah Chen  
Supply Chain Director

Sarah,

This is concerning. How will this impact Q4 revenue projections?

**Additional Actions Required:**
1. Customer compensation plan for delayed orders
- Free expedited shipping on backorders
- 15% discount on next purchase for affected customers
2. Media communication strategy to manage expectations
3. Cross-functional crisis team meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 10 AM

Let's ensure we maintain customer trust while protecting our margins.

Michael,

Revenue impact estimated at 8-12% if shortages persist beyond 2 weeks. We're implementing mitigation strategies.

**Updated Response Plan:**
- Customer compensation: Free expedited shipping + 15% discount on next purchase
- Media strategy: Proactive social media updates and press release
- Crisis team meeting: Confirmed for tomorrow, agenda attached

We're also exploring air freight options for critical items to reduce delivery times.

Sarah, Michael,

The compensation plan is generous. I'll prepare the communication templates and social media content.

**Marketing Support:**
- Email campaign to affected customers with transparency updates
- Social media content emphasizing our commitment to customer satisfaction
- Loyalty program bonus points for customers experiencing delays

This positions us as responsive rather than reactive.
