Team,

We're experiencing temporary shortages on several popular items due to supply chain delays. Here's the approved communication approach:

**Customer Email Template:**

Subject: Update on [Product Name] Availability

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for your interest in [Product Name]. Due to high demand and supply chain challenges, this item is currently out of stock.

**What we're doing:**
- Monitoring supplier updates daily
- Prioritizing restocking for our most popular items
- Offering alternative product recommendations

**Your options:**
1. Sign up for restock notifications
2. Consider similar items currently available
3. Contact us for personalized recommendations

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience.

**Week 1 Update:**

**Continued focus:**
- Daily inventory monitoring with automated alerts
- Proactive customer outreach via email and SMS campaigns
- Alternative product promotion with bundled offers
- Cross-channel inventory visibility for online and in-store coordination

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Escalation procedure: If shortage extends beyond 3 weeks, activate crisis communication protocol
- Stakeholder impact: Minimal revenue loss (<5%) due to effective alternative sales
- Lessons learned: Enhanced supplier communication protocols for future disruptions

**Performance Metrics:**
- Customer retention rate: 98% (vs. 95% industry average)
- Alternative product conversion: 22% of affected customers
- Response time to inquiries: <2 hours average
- Social media sentiment: 85% positive mentions

**Preventive Measures for Future:**
- Implement predictive inventory analytics to anticipate shortages
- Diversify supplier base to reduce single-point failures
- Enhance vendor performance monitoring and SLA enforcement
- Develop contingency inventory reserves for high-demand items

This structured approach is maintaining customer trust during the shortage period while driving incremental sales through strategic product recommendations and establishing best practices for future supply chain resilience.
