## Email Thread: Product Return Process Issue

**From:** Customer Service Manager

**Subject:** Urgent: Customer Complaint - Damaged Product Delivery

**Date:** September 29, 2025

Team,

We've received a formal complaint from a premium customer regarding a damaged item delivered from our online store. The customer spent $500 on a high-end appliance that arrived with visible shipping damage.

Customer details:
- Order #12345
- Purchase date: Sept 25, 2025
- Delivery date: Sept 27, 2025
- Customer: Sarah Johnson (loyal customer, $15K lifetime value)

The customer has posted about this on social media and threatened to leave a negative review. I need your immediate assistance to resolve this.

Can we arrange for a replacement to be shipped today with expedited delivery? Also, should we offer a goodwill gesture like a discount on their next purchase?

Please advise on next steps.

Best,
Maria Rodriguez
Customer Service Manager

Maria,

I reviewed the order details. The item was shipped from our central warehouse. I've checked the packing photos - it looks like the damage occurred during transit, not at our facility.

I recommend:
1. Immediate replacement shipment (expedited)
2. $50 store credit as goodwill
3. Follow-up call from our customer service team

This should turn this around. Let me know if you need me to coordinate with the warehouse.

Regards,
Tom Wilson
Store Manager

Good coordination here. Maria, please proceed with the replacement and credit. Tom, ensure the warehouse reviews their packing procedures for similar items.

Let's also monitor social media and respond professionally if needed. This customer is valuable - we want to retain them.

Approved.

Team,

The replacement item has been shipped with overnight delivery, and the $50 store credit has been applied to the customer's account. I personally called the customer to apologize and confirm the resolution.

She was appreciative of the quick response and mentioned she'll continue shopping with us. No further social media posts have appeared.

For future prevention, I've noted this in our quality incident log for the warehouse team to review packing standards for appliances.

Thanks for the quick coordination.

Best,
Maria Rodriguez
