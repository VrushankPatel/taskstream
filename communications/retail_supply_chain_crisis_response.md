**Subject:** Urgent: Supply Chain Crisis Response Plan Activation

Team,

Following the recent port congestion and transportation delays affecting our key suppliers, I've activated our Supply Chain Crisis Response Plan. This impacts approximately 40% of our inventory categories with potential delays of 2-4 weeks.

**Current Situation:**
- Container ship delays at major ports affecting imported goods
- Rail transportation constraints due to weather events
- Increased fuel costs impacting trucking availability

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
1. Activated alternative supplier network (15 backup vendors contacted)
2. Implemented inventory reallocation across regions
3. Adjusted safety stock levels for critical items
4. Communicated with customers about potential delays

**Expected Impact:**
- Temporary stockouts in electronics and home goods categories
- Increased carrying costs for expedited shipments
- Potential revenue impact of $2.5M if delays extend beyond 3 weeks

**Next Steps:**
- Daily monitoring of supplier updates
- Customer communication campaign starting tomorrow
- Contingency purchasing budget of $500K approved

Please review the attached detailed response plan and let me know if you need additional resources for your areas.

Best,
Sarah Chen

Sarah and team,

Marketing has prepared customer communication materials including:
- Email templates for affected customers
- Social media posts explaining the situation
- FAQ section for our website
- Promotional offers to maintain customer loyalty

We recommend proactive communication rather than reactive to maintain trust. The materials emphasize our commitment to resolving the situation quickly and offering alternatives where possible.

Ready to launch upon approval.
