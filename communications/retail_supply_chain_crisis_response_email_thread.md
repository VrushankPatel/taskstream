**Subject:** Urgent: Supply Chain Disruption - Immediate Action Required

Team,

I've just received notification from our primary supplier that a major production facility fire has halted all shipments for the next 2-3 weeks. This affects 40% of our inventory across electronics and home goods categories.

Immediate actions needed:

1. Contact alternative suppliers for emergency stock

2. Implement allocation controls in our system

3. Prepare customer communication plan

4. Review safety stock levels

Please respond with your team's availability for an emergency meeting at 2 PM today.

Best,

Sarah Johnson

Supply Chain Director
