**Subject:** Urgent: Supply Chain Disruption - Immediate Response Required  

Team,

I'm writing to inform you of a critical supply chain disruption affecting our primary distribution center. Due to severe weather conditions and transportation delays, we're experiencing a 48-hour delay in receiving shipments for high-volume products across 75% of our stores.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Store managers: Conduct inventory audits and prioritize essential items
2. Marketing team: Prepare customer communication templates
3. Customer service: Staff up for increased inquiry volume
4. Procurement: Identify alternative suppliers for critical items

**Impact Assessment:**
- Estimated sales impact: $2.4M over next 72 hours
- Customer satisfaction risk: High for affected product categories
- Recovery timeline: Full restoration expected by end of week

Please respond with your team's readiness status and any additional support needs.

Best,  
Sarah Chen  
Supply Chain Director
