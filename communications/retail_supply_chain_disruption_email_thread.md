## Email Thread: Retail Supply Chain Disruption Response

**From:** Supply Chain Director

**Subject:** Urgent: Semiconductor Chip Shortage Impacting Product Availability  

Team,

Following our quarterly supply chain review, I've identified a critical semiconductor shortage that will impact our electronics product lines. This is affecting multiple vendors and creating 6-8 week delays on high-demand items.

Key impacts:
- 40% of our electronics inventory at risk
- Projected $2.3M revenue impact this quarter
- Customer service calls increasing 25%

I recommend immediate actions:
1. Prioritize allocation to high-margin products
2. Communicate transparently with customers
3. Explore alternative sourcing options

Please advise on prioritization approach.

Best,  
Sarah Chen  
Supply Chain Director

Adding to Sarah's points - our customer service team is already seeing increased frustration. We need to prepare messaging that acknowledges the issue while highlighting our efforts to resolve it.

Suggested customer communication:
- Proactive email notifications to affected customers
- Extended return windows for delayed orders
- Loyalty program credits as compensation

This will help maintain satisfaction scores.

From operations perspective, we can optimize warehouse space by shifting inventory. Also, we should consider temporary price adjustments on affected products to manage demand.

Let me know if you need detailed warehouse capacity analysis.
