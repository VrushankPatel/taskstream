**Subject:** Critical: Port Congestion Impacting Q4 Inventory - Immediate Action Required  

**Date:** November 8, 2024  

Team,

I'm writing to inform you of a critical supply chain disruption that will impact our Q4 inventory and holiday season operations. Due to unprecedented congestion at major ports, we're experiencing significant delays in container shipments from Asia.

**Current Situation:**
- 40% of our Q4 inventory shipments delayed by 4-6 weeks
- Key product categories affected: electronics, toys, and seasonal merchandise
- Estimated revenue impact: $12-15M if unmitigated

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Activating alternative sourcing from domestic suppliers
2. Implementing allocation controls on high-demand items
3. Preparing customer communications about potential delays

**Required Support:**
- Marketing: Develop messaging for delayed product communications
- Sales: Prepare contingency plans for Q4 promotions
- Finance: Model various scenarios and cash flow impacts

We'll have a crisis management meeting tomorrow at 9 AM. Please come prepared with your department's mitigation strategies.

This is a challenging situation, but our team's response will determine how we navigate through it.

Best,  
David Rodriguez  
Chief Supply Chain Officer

David,

This is concerning. From marketing's perspective:

- We have major holiday campaigns launching next week featuring these delayed products
- Customer expectations are high for holiday delivery guarantees
- Social media could amplify any service issues

We're already developing alternative campaign messaging focusing on in-stock items and extended shipping options. Should we pause the affected campaigns?

Lisa,

Good point about the campaigns. Let's discuss this tomorrow, but I suggest we:

1. Adjust messaging to highlight available inventory
2. Offer incentives for customers willing to wait for delayed items
3. Be transparent about delays to maintain trust

The key is managing expectations while maximizing available inventory sales.
