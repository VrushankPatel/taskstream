## Email Thread: Retail Supply Chain Disruption Response

**From:** Supply Chain Director  
**To:** Executive Leadership Team, Store Managers, Procurement Team  
**Subject:** Urgent: Supply Disruption Response Plan - Electronics Category  

Team,

Following the recent port congestion issues affecting our electronics suppliers, I've activated our contingency response protocol. Key impacts:

- 3-week delay on smartphone inventory (representing 25% of category sales)
- Alternative sourcing identified with 15% cost premium
- Customer communications plan initiated

Immediate actions required:
1. Store managers: Implement inventory rationing for high-demand items
2. Procurement: Accelerate alternative supplier contracts
3. Marketing: Prepare customer notification campaign

Please confirm receipt and execution status by EOD.

Best,

Sarah,

Our flagship store has already seen increased foot traffic for electronics. We've implemented the rationing protocol and are monitoring customer feedback.

One concern: Some customers are frustrated with limited options. Should we offer rain checks or loyalty points as compensation?

Let me know if you need store-level data for the leadership call.

Thanks,  
Jennifer Liu  
Store Operations Manager
