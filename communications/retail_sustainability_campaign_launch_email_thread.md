Sarah,

The store team is excited about this initiative. We'll need additional training materials for part-time staff. Can we schedule a virtual training session for June 20th?

Also, we're concerned about inventory levels for the new sustainable products. Current stock will only last 2 weeks at projected sales volumes.

Team,

The campaign launched successfully yesterday. Early results are encouraging:

- Website traffic up 35%
- Social media engagement increased 50%
- Initial sustainable product sales 40% above projections

Store feedback has been positive, though we're seeing some supply chain challenges with organic cotton products.

Will provide full week 1 analysis by Friday.
