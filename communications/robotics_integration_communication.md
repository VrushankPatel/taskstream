- **Integration Points:** PLC systems, vision inspection, conveyor controls
- **Software:** Custom programming with vendor API integration
- **Testing:** 4-week pilot phase before full deployment

**Action:** Dr. Chen to provide detailed technical specifications by next week

### Safety Considerations
- **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive safety analysis completed - all systems rated Category 3
- **Safety Features:** Light curtains, safety-rated PLCs, emergency stop systems
- **Training Requirements:** 40-hour robotics safety training for all affected operators
- **PPE Updates:** New safety protocols for collaborative robot workspaces

**Concern Raised:** Mark Johnson noted potential for operator anxiety with robots in shared workspaces

### Change Management

- **Training Program:** 3-tier training (awareness, operation, maintenance)
- **Job Impact Assessment:** 12 positions affected - 8 retraining opportunities, 4 redeployment options
- **Resistance Mitigation:** Early operator involvement, success story sharing, transparent communication

**Action:** Sarah Williams to develop detailed change management plan

### Timeline and Milestones
- **Month 1-2:** Design and procurement
- **Month 3-4:** Installation and integration
- **Month 5-6:** Testing and operator training
- **Month 7-8:** Full deployment and optimization

**Risk:** Potential 6-week delay due to vendor delivery schedules

### Resource Requirements
- **Internal Team:** 4 FTEs dedicated to project
- **External Support:** Vendor engineering support, safety consultants
- **Training Budget:** $150K for training programs and materials
- **Contingency:** 15% budget contingency for unforeseen issues

## Action Items
