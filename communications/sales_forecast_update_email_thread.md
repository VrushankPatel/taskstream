Team,  

Following our weekly forecast review, I'm sharing updated Q3 projections. Current pipeline momentum is strong, but we've adjusted expectations based on deal timing.  

Key updates:  
- Pipeline coverage improved to 4.1x quota  
- Average deal size up 8% YoY  
- Close rate trending at 32% (up from 28%)  

Revised forecast: $14.2M (was $13.8M)  
- Best case: $15.5M  
- Worst case: $12.8M  
- Confidence level: 75%  

Main drivers: Enterprise segment performing above expectations, SMB showing seasonal slowdown.  

Please review the attached forecast model and provide feedback by EOD Friday.  

Thanks,  
Alex

Good work on the improved pipeline coverage, Alex. The enterprise momentum is encouraging.  

Two questions:  
1. What's the breakdown by segment for the upside potential?  
2. Any specific deals we should focus executive attention on?  

Looking forward to the team input.

Appreciate the transparency on the forecast. The improved outlook helps with our planning.  

From finance perspective:  
- The upside scenario would improve gross margins by 2%  
- We're comfortable with the risk profile at current confidence levels  
- Please keep us updated on the key deals mentioned  

Good progress overall.
