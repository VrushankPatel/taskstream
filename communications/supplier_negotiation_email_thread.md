Team,

We've reached the final round of negotiations with CloudTech for our infrastructure services contract. Here's where we stand:

**Current Terms:**
- Annual contract value: $2.4M
- Service level: 99.9% uptime
- Term: 3 years with 1-year renewal option
- Payment terms: Net 60
- Termination: 90 days notice

**Open Issues:**
1. Data sovereignty requirements (we need EU data centers)
2. Disaster recovery testing frequency (quarterly vs. annual)
3. Price escalation cap (3% vs. 5%)
4. Service credits for outages

Legal has reviewed the contract language. Please let me know your thoughts on these points before our call tomorrow.

From an engineering perspective:

- EU data centers are critical for our GDPR compliance
- Quarterly DR testing is essential for our risk management
- 3% escalation cap is reasonable given current inflation

The 99.9% SLA should be sufficient for our needs.

Legal review complete. The contract is solid, but we need to strengthen:

- Data processing agreement for GDPR compliance
- Clear liability limits for data breaches
- Audit rights for compliance verification

The EU data center requirement should be specified in the SLA section.

Thanks for the feedback. We can accommodate:

- EU data centers: Available in Frankfurt and Ireland
- DR testing: Can do quarterly at no extra cost
- Escalation cap: We can go to 3.5% to meet you halfway

For service credits, we propose 5% credit for outages exceeding 4 hours in a month.

Call scheduled for 2 PM tomorrow to discuss.
