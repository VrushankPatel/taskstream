## Email Announcement: Sustainable Energy Carbon Capture Deployment Launch

**From:** Chief Sustainability Officer  
**To:** All Employees, Investors, Media Contacts, Community Stakeholders  
**Subject:** Major Milestone: Launch of Carbon Capture and Storage Project  
**Date:** November 5, 2025  

Dear Colleagues and Stakeholders,

I am excited to announce the official launch of our carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at the East River Power Plant. This initiative represents a significant step forward in our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and combating climate change.

### Project Overview
The CCS system will capture up to 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from the power plant's flue gas, preventing approximately 1.2 million tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere annually. The captured CO2 will be compressed, transported via pipeline, and permanently stored in deep underground geological formations.

### Key Project Details
- **Capacity:** 1.2 million tons of CO2 captured per year  
- **Technology:** Post-combustion amine-based capture system  
- **Timeline:** Construction completed in 18 months, full operation by Q3 2027  
- **Investment:** $85 million (including $25 million in federal grants)  
- **Jobs Created:** 75 full-time positions during construction, 25 ongoing operations roles  

### Environmental Impact
This project will:
- Reduce our facility's carbon emissions by 35%  
- Demonstrate scalable CCS technology for the energy sector  
- Contribute to regional air quality improvements  
- Support state and federal climate goals  

### Community and Stakeholder Engagement
We have worked closely with local communities, environmental groups, and regulatory agencies throughout the planning process. Key engagement activities include:

- Public information sessions with 200+ attendees  
- Collaboration with local environmental organizations  
- Economic impact studies showing net benefits to the community  
- Ongoing monitoring and transparency commitments  

### Next Steps
- Construction mobilization begins December 2025  
- Community open house scheduled for January 2026  
- Regular progress updates through our sustainability newsletter  
- Invitation to join our stakeholder advisory committee  

### Our Commitment
This CCS project is part of our broader sustainability strategy that includes renewable energy investments, energy efficiency programs, and carbon offset initiatives. We believe that technological innovation, combined with stakeholder collaboration, is essential for addressing climate change.

We invite you to learn more about this project and our sustainability efforts. Please visit our website or contact the sustainability team for additional information.

Together, we are building a cleaner energy future.
