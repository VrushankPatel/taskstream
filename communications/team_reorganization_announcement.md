# Internal Announcement: Sales Team Reorganization

**From:** David Martinez, Chief Revenue Officer
**To:** All Employees
**Subject:** Sales Organization Update - Building for Scale
**Date:** September 30, 2025

Team,

I'm excited to announce changes to our sales organization that will position us for continued growth and better customer success. After extensive analysis of our sales performance, market opportunities, and team feedback, we've restructured the sales organization to better serve our customers and drive revenue growth.

## Key Changes

### New Structure
We've transitioned from a geographic model to an industry-vertical model:

**Enterprise Sales Division**
- **Director:** Rachel Simmons (formerly Midwest Regional Director)
- **Focus:** Companies with >1000 employees
- **Team:** 8 Account Executives, 3 Solutions Engineers

**Mid-Market Sales Division**
- **Director:** James Wilson (formerly East Coast Regional Director)
- **Focus:** Companies with 100-1000 employees
- **Team:** 12 Account Executives, 2 Solutions Engineers

**Commercial Sales Division**
- **Director:** Lisa Chen (formerly West Coast Regional Director)
- **Focus:** Companies with <100 employees
- **Team:** 6 Account Executives, 1 Solutions Engineer

### New Roles Created
- **Industry Solutions Specialists:** 3 new roles focused on healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing verticals
- **Customer Success Manager:** Expanded team by 4 to support post-sale onboarding

## Why This Change?
Our analysis showed that customers in similar industries face similar challenges, regardless of geography. This structure allows our teams to develop deeper expertise and provide more targeted solutions.

## Transition Timeline
- **October 1-15:** Team meetings and training on new structure
- **October 16-31:** Territory and account reassignments
- **November 1:** Official launch of new organization

## Support During Transition
- All current quotas and commissions will be honored through Q4
- Training sessions on industry verticals: October 3, 7, and 10
- One-on-one meetings with managers to discuss individual transitions
- HR business partners available for any concerns

## What This Means for You
If you're in sales, you'll have more focused territories and clearer paths to specialization. For other departments, you'll work with more knowledgeable sales partners who understand your industry challenges.

I'm confident this structure will accelerate our growth and improve customer satisfaction. Please join me in congratulating the new directors and welcoming our new team members.

If you have questions, please reach out to your manager or HR partner.

Best regards,
David Martinez
Chief Revenue Officer
