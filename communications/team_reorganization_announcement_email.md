**Subject:** Engineering Team Reorganization - Building for Scale
**Date:** December 1, 2025

Team,

I'm writing to announce an important reorganization of our Engineering organization, effective January 1, 2026. This restructuring is designed to support our rapid growth and position us for the next phase of our journey.

**Key Changes:**

1. **New VP of Engineering Role**
   - We're promoting Alex Rivera to VP of Engineering
   - Alex will oversee all engineering functions and report directly to me
   - This role will focus on technical strategy and team development

2. **Product Engineering Split**
   - Creating two product engineering teams to improve focus and velocity
   - Team Alpha: Consumer-facing products (led by Maria Gonzalez)
   - Team Beta: Enterprise solutions (led by James Chen)
   - Each team will have dedicated design and QA resources

3. **New Platform Team**
   - Establishing a centralized platform team for shared infrastructure
   - This team will focus on developer tools, CI/CD, and cloud architecture
   - Led by Sarah Kim, our current DevOps lead

4. **Engineering Operations**
   - Creating a new Engineering Operations function
   - This team will handle hiring, professional development, and process improvement
   - Led by David Park, joining us from Google

**Why This Change:**
Our current structure served us well during the startup phase, but as we've grown to 180 engineers, we've seen some challenges:
- Coordination overhead between teams
- Competing priorities across products
- Scaling hiring and onboarding processes

This new structure will:
- Reduce dependencies between teams
- Improve focus on customer needs
- Accelerate our product development velocity
- Support sustainable growth

**Transition Timeline:**
- December 1-15: Team leads work with managers on new reporting structures
- December 16-31: Individual meetings to discuss roles and career paths
- January 1: New structure goes live

**Support During Transition:**
- All current roles are preserved with the same compensation
- We'll provide career coaching for anyone interested in new opportunities
- Open office hours with HR and the new leadership team

If you have questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can schedule time with me, your manager, or HR directly.

This is an exciting time for our company, and I'm confident this reorganization will enable us to deliver even better products and experiences for our customers.

Best,
Jennifer Walsh
CEO

Hi everyone,

I'm honored to take on the VP of Engineering role and excited about our future. I've worked with many of you over the past two years and know we have an incredibly talented team.

The new structure is designed to give each team more autonomy while maintaining collaboration. We'll have regular all-hands and cross-team syncs to ensure we're aligned.

I'm looking forward to meeting with each of you individually over the next few weeks to discuss the changes and your career goals.

Alex
