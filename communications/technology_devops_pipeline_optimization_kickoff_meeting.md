## Meeting Notes: DevOps Pipeline Optimization Kickoff

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM  
**Location:** Conference Room A  
**Attendees:** Sarah Chen (VP Engineering), Mike Rodriguez (DevOps Lead), Lisa Wong (Senior Developer), David Kim (QA Manager), Alex Thompson (Product Owner)  
**Facilitator:** Sarah Chen  

### Agenda
1. Current pipeline pain points review
2. Optimization goals and success metrics
3. Proposed solution overview
4. Implementation timeline and responsibilities
5. Next steps

### Discussion Summary

**Current State Assessment:**
- Build times averaging 45 minutes, causing developer frustration
- Test automation coverage at 65%, leading to production bugs
- Manual deployment processes requiring 2 hours per release
- Infrastructure provisioning taking 3-4 days for new environments

**Key Pain Points Identified:**
- Legacy Jenkins setup with complex configurations
- Lack of standardized CI/CD practices across teams
- Insufficient monitoring and alerting
- Knowledge silos between development and operations

**Optimization Goals:**
- Reduce build times to under 15 minutes
- Achieve 90% test automation coverage
- Enable self-service deployments
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

**Proposed Solution:**
- Migrate to GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Adopt containerization with Kubernetes
- Integrate automated security scanning and performance testing

**Success Metrics:**
- 70% reduction in build times
- 50% decrease in production incidents
- 80% increase in deployment frequency
- 95% test automation coverage

### Action Items
- **Mike Rodriguez:** Research and recommend GitHub Actions migration strategy (Due: Oct 22)
- **Lisa Wong:** Document current pipeline configurations and dependencies (Due: Oct 20)
- **David Kim:** Assess testing gaps and automation opportunities (Due: Oct 25)
- **Alex Thompson:** Define deployment requirements from product perspective (Due: Oct 18)
- **Sarah Chen:** Schedule follow-up meeting with infrastructure team (Due: Oct 17)

### Risks and Concerns
- Potential disruption during migration period
- Team training requirements for new tools
- Integration challenges with existing monitoring systems
- Budget constraints for cloud resource scaling

### Next Meeting
