2. Technical architecture review
3. Timeline and milestones
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Next steps

### Discussion Summary

**Project Overview**
Sarah opened the meeting by outlining the strategic importance of edge computing for reducing latency in our global user base. The initiative aims to deploy edge nodes in 12 key regions, reducing average response time from 150ms to under 50ms.

**Technical Architecture**
Mike presented the proposed architecture:
- Kubernetes-based orchestration at edge locations
- Automated deployment pipelines for edge applications
- Centralized monitoring and management console
- Integration with existing CDN infrastructure

Key decision: Standardize on ARM-based edge servers for cost efficiency, with x86 fallback for legacy applications.

**Timeline Discussion**
Lisa reviewed the aggressive 6-month rollout plan:
- Month 1-2: Pilot deployment in 2 regions
- Month 3-4: Full deployment to 8 additional regions
- Month 5-6: Optimization and monitoring implementation

**Risk Assessment**
David highlighted security concerns:
- Supply chain risks for edge hardware
- Data residency compliance across regions
- Network security for distributed infrastructure

Mitigation strategies discussed:
- Multi-vendor hardware procurement
- Automated security policy enforcement
- Regular compliance audits

**Action Items**
- Sarah: Secure executive approval for $2.5M budget by EOW
- Mike: Complete detailed architecture document by Friday
- Lisa: Schedule DevOps team training sessions
- David: Draft security requirements document
- Alex: Define success metrics and KPIs

### Next Meeting
Weekly status updates every Tuesday at 2 PM. First full team demo in 2 weeks.

**Meeting Adjourned:** 3:30 PM
