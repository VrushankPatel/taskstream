## Meeting Notes: Quantum Computing Adoption Strategy Session

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM  
**Location:** Conference Room A  
**Attendees:**  
- VP Advanced Technologies (Chair)  
- CTO  
- CFO  
- Chief Scientist  
- Head of Research  
- Legal Counsel  
- Ethics Board Representative  
- Industry Partner (Quantum Computing Vendor)  

**Objective:** Evaluate quantum computing adoption strategy and make go/no-go decision for research center establishment.

**Key Discussion Points:**

1. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**  
   - Quantum hardware evaluation completed - IBM, Google, and Rigetti systems assessed  
   - Current error rates still too high for production use (10^-3 vs required 10^-9)  
   - Research applications in optimization problems show promise  
   - Infrastructure requirements: dedicated quantum-safe data center, $15M investment  

2. **Business Case Review**  
   - Logistics optimization: 100-1000x speedup potential for route optimization  
   - Drug discovery partnerships: accelerated molecular modeling capabilities  
   - Competitive positioning: Early mover advantage in quantum ecosystem  
   - ROI projections: $500M in new business opportunities over 5 years  

3. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Technology immaturity: 5-7 year timeline to practical quantum advantage  
   - Talent scarcity: Need to hire 20+ quantum physicists/engineers  
   - Security concerns: Quantum-resistant encryption requirements  
   - Ethical considerations: Dual-use technology implications  

4. **Implementation Plan**  
   - Phase 1: Research center establishment ($25M, 12 months)  
   - Phase 2: Pilot applications in logistics ($15M, 18 months)  
   - Phase 3: Drug discovery partnerships ($10M, 24 months)  

**Decisions Made:**

1. **Approved:** Proceed with Phase 1 research center establishment  
2. **Approved:** Allocate $25M budget for quantum computing initiative  
3. **Approved:** Form quantum ethics oversight committee  
4. **Action Item:** Develop detailed security protocols for quantum systems  

**Next Steps:**

- Legal: Complete export control compliance review (2 weeks)  
- Procurement: Issue RFP for quantum hardware vendors (4 weeks)  
- HR: Launch quantum talent recruitment campaign (6 weeks)  
- Ethics Board: Establish quantum computing governance framework (4 weeks)  

**Follow-up Meeting:** November 1, 2025 - Pilot program detailed planning
