Team,

We are experiencing a critical network outage affecting approximately 150,000 customers in the downtown metro area. The outage began at 2:15 PM and is impacting voice, data, and internet services.

Initial assessment indicates a fiber cut at the main distribution hub. Engineering teams are en route and ETA for repair is 4 hours.

Customer Care teams should prepare for increased call volume. We've activated our emergency response protocol.

Status updates will be provided every 30 minutes.

Please advise if additional resources are needed.

Alex,

This is unacceptable. What's the root cause and what measures are we taking to prevent future occurrences?

Please coordinate with PR for customer communications and ensure we have accurate status updates for our social media channels.

We need to minimize the business impact - many customers rely on our services for critical operations.

Michael,

Confirmed fiber cut caused by construction crew. We've dispatched emergency repair crews with redundant fiber routes.

To prevent future incidents:
- Enhanced monitoring of construction permits
- Additional fiber route diversity
- Improved incident response protocols

PR has been notified and we're preparing customer notifications via SMS and app alerts.

Current ETA for full restoration: 6:00 PM.

Apologies for the inconvenience.

Alex, Michael,

Customer Care has activated 50 additional agents and we're offering service credits automatically. Call volume is 300% above normal.

Can we get real-time outage map updates for our agents to provide accurate information?

Also, please confirm when we'll have backup systems online.

Thanks,
