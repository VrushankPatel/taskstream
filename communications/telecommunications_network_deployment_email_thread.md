## Email Thread: 5G Network Deployment Delay Communication

**Subject:** Update on 5G Network Deployment - Timeline Adjustment Required

**Date:** October 15, 2025

Team,

I need to provide an important update on our 5G network deployment initiative. After thorough review with our engineering teams and equipment suppliers, we've identified several challenges that will require a 3-month delay to our original Q4 2025 launch timeline.

Key factors contributing to this delay:
1. Supply chain constraints for specialized antenna equipment
2. Additional regulatory testing requirements
3. Integration complexities with existing 4G infrastructure

Our revised timeline now targets Q1 2026 completion. This will allow us to ensure network reliability and meet all safety standards. The additional time will also enable us to incorporate the latest security enhancements.

Financial impact: Approximately $2.5M in additional costs, primarily for extended contractor support and equipment staging.

I've scheduled a detailed briefing for next Tuesday at 2 PM to discuss mitigation strategies and ensure we maintain our competitive position in the 5G market.

Please let me know if you need any additional information before the meeting.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
VP Network Operations

Sarah,

Thank you for the proactive communication. While disappointing, this delay is understandable given the complexities of 5G deployment.

Key priorities:
1. Ensure we don't lose market momentum to competitors
2. Maintain customer communication about service improvements
3. Explore partnership opportunities to accelerate deployment

Let's use the additional time to incorporate cutting-edge features that will differentiate our network.

I'll attend the briefing next Tuesday.

Sarah, Michael,

The $2.5M cost increase is within our contingency budget for this project. However, I recommend we review the supplier contracts to explore penalty clauses or alternative sourcing options.

Can you provide a detailed cost breakdown by category for the executive review?

Also, what are the revenue implications of the delay? Should we adjust our Q4 guidance?

Thanks,
Jennifer Walsh

Jennifer,

Attached is the detailed cost breakdown. The additional costs break down as:
- Extended contractor support: $1.2M
- Equipment staging and storage: $800K
- Additional regulatory testing: $500K

Revenue impact assessment: Minimal for Q4 as our current 4G network continues to perform well. We may see some delay in enterprise customer acquisitions targeting Q1 2026.

I'll have the supplier contract review completed by Monday.

Best,
Sarah

Sarah,

Good analysis. The additional time gives us opportunity to integrate the new edge computing capabilities we discussed last month. This could actually strengthen our market position.

Can we accelerate the security enhancements to be ready by year-end?
