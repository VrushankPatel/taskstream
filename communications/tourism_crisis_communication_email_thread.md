**Subject:** Natural Disaster Impact on Tourist Destinations - Communication Plan

Team,

As you know, the recent hurricane has severely impacted our Caribbean resort properties. We've had to evacuate 2,500 guests and close operations temporarily.

Key challenges:
- Guest safety and relocation logistics
- Media inquiries from international press
- Refund processing for affected bookings
- Long-term reputation management

I've drafted an initial communication plan focusing on transparency and guest support. We need to coordinate messaging across all channels.

Please review the attached plan and let's discuss in the emergency meeting at 10 AM.

Best,
Elena Rodriguez
Director of Communications

Elena,

The plan looks solid. Let's emphasize our commitment to guest safety above all else. I suggest we offer complimentary stays for affected guests once operations resume.

Also, we should prepare social media content showing our response efforts - photos of staff assisting guests, etc.

Good plan. From operations side, we need to be realistic about reopening timelines. Current estimate is 3-4 weeks for full restoration.

Let's coordinate with local authorities for joint press releases to show we're working together on recovery.
