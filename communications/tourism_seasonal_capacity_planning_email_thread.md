## Email Thread: Seasonal Capacity Planning

**From:** Revenue Manager

**Subject:** Peak Season Capacity Optimization Strategy  

Team,

With summer bookings up 35% year-over-year, we're facing capacity constraints at our mountain resorts.

Current challenges:
- Overbooking risk on premium cabins
- Staff scheduling for 40% occupancy increase
- Inventory management for seasonal equipment

I've developed a capacity optimization plan including dynamic pricing, staff augmentation, and equipment leasing.

Budget impact: $500K for additional staffing and equipment.

Please review and approve.

Best,  
Maria Santos  
Revenue Manager

Maria,

The plan addresses our key constraints. From operations, we can handle the staff augmentation but need to ensure equipment quality standards.

Let's schedule a walkthrough of the resorts next week to validate capacity assumptions.

Team,

This is excellent growth. Approve the budget - we can't afford to turn away guests.

Maria - implement immediately. Operations - coordinate the site visits.
