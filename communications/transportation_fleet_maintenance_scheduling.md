## Email Thread: Fleet Maintenance Scheduling Update

**From:** Fleet Operations Manager
**To:** Regional Directors, Maintenance Supervisors
**Subject:** Q4 Fleet Maintenance Schedule - Capacity Constraints Update

Team,

Following our quarterly maintenance planning meeting, I need to provide an update on our Q4 fleet maintenance schedule. We're experiencing higher than anticipated vehicle utilization across all regions, which is impacting our ability to schedule routine maintenance without disrupting service levels.

**Current Situation:**
- 23% increase in maintenance requests vs Q3
- 85% fleet utilization rate (up from 78% last quarter)
- Limited availability at our primary maintenance facility

**Proposed Adjustments:**
- Extend maintenance windows to include Saturdays (8 AM - 2 PM)
- Implement predictive maintenance scheduling based on telematics data
- Partner with external service providers for overflow work

**Impact Assessment:**
- Minimal service disruption (estimated 2% reduction in on-time performance)
- $450K cost increase for external maintenance services
- Improved vehicle reliability and reduced breakdown incidents

Please review your regional schedules and confirm capacity by COB Friday. We'll need to prioritize critical maintenance items and defer non-essential work to Q1.

Let me know if you need additional resources or have concerns about these changes.

Best,
Mike Chen

Mike,

The Midwest region is particularly constrained with our Chicago hub at 95% utilization. The Saturday maintenance window will help, but we'll need to bring in temporary staff for the additional shifts.

Can we prioritize the refrigerated fleet maintenance first? We're seeing increased food delivery demands and can't afford breakdowns in that segment.

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson
Regional Director - Midwest

Sarah,

Good point on the refrigerated fleet priority. I've updated the schedule to prioritize temperature-controlled vehicles across all regions.

For staffing, I've approved budget for 4 temporary maintenance technicians ($75K total) to support the Saturday shifts. HR will coordinate the hiring this week.

Let's schedule a quick call tomorrow at 10 AM to review the updated prioritization.

Best,
Mike

Mike,

The external provider partnership sounds good, but we need to ensure they meet our quality standards. Can we include a quality audit clause in the contracts?

Also, the telematics data is showing some anomalies in the Northeast fleet - might indicate a pattern we should investigate before scheduling.
