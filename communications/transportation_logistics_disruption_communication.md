## Email Thread: Supply Chain Disruption Crisis Response

**Subject:** URGENT: Port Congestion Impacting All West Coast Shipments  

Team,

I'm writing to inform you of a critical supply chain disruption that will impact our operations for the next 4-6 weeks. The Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach congestion has reached unprecedented levels, with over 100 container ships waiting offshore.

Current Impact Assessment:
- All West Coast imports delayed by 2-3 weeks minimum
- Container availability reduced by 40%
- Fuel surcharge increases of 15-20% expected
- Potential for further delays if labor negotiations fail

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Customer communications team to notify affected clients by EOD
2. Procurement to secure alternative routing through East Coast ports
3. Operations to prioritize critical shipments for air freight conversion
4. Finance to prepare budget impact analysis

Please prepare contingency plans for your areas and report back by 5 PM with mitigation strategies.

Regards,  
Jennifer Walsh  
Director of Logistics

Jennifer,

Customer Service has initiated notification protocols for our top 50 accounts. We're prioritizing communications based on shipment criticality and customer tier.

Current status:
- Tier 1 customers (85% of revenue): Personal calls completed to key contacts
- Automated email notifications sent to all affected customers
- Dedicated hotline established for urgent inquiries
- Alternative delivery options being offered (air freight premium)

However, we're already receiving pushback from several large clients threatening to explore alternative providers. Request approval to offer discounted rates for expedited air freight options.

Best,  
Marcus Rodriguez  
Customer Service Director

The financial impact of this disruption is significant. Preliminary analysis shows:

- Revenue impact: $2.8M in delayed shipments this quarter
- Cost increases: $450K in fuel and equipment surcharges
- Mitigation costs: $320K for air freight conversions
- Total estimated impact: $3.57M (8.5% of quarterly revenue)

We're working with our insurance broker to determine coverage for business interruption. However, customer retention is our primary concern - I support offering temporary rate concessions for critical shipments.

Approval needed for $500K contingency budget for crisis management.
