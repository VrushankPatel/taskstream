Team,

I need to inform you of a critical transportation disruption that will impact our supply chain operations. A major storm system has caused widespread flooding across our primary shipping routes, affecting multiple distribution centers and transportation hubs.

**Current Situation:**
- 3 major highways closed due to flooding
- Rail service suspended on 2 key routes
- 40% of our trucking fleet unable to operate
- Estimated duration: 5-7 days before partial recovery

**Immediate Impacts:**
- Inbound material deliveries delayed by 3-5 days
- Outbound shipments to customers postponed
- Production lines at 2 facilities may need to halt operations
- Customer delivery commitments at risk

**Response Actions Required:**
1. Operations: Implement contingency production schedules
2. Procurement: Source alternative transportation providers
3. Customer Success: Communicate delays to affected customers
4. Finance: Assess financial impact and insurance claims

Please respond with your team's action plan within 2 hours. We'll reconvene at 3 PM for a full status update.

Supply Chain Director,

Operations team is mobilizing our contingency plan:

- Shifting production to Facility B which has better inventory levels
- Implementing overtime shifts to build buffer stock
- Contacting alternative suppliers for critical components

We can maintain 70% of normal production capacity if the disruption lasts 5 days or less.

Thank you for the rapid response. The coordinated approach gives me confidence we'll minimize the impact.

Key decisions:
1. Approve contingency spending up to $500K for alternative transportation
2. Activate customer retention fund of $200K
3. Daily executive briefings until full recovery

Let's execute on this plan and keep customers informed throughout.
