{"id": "technology_serverless_computing_security_policy", "content": "# Serverless Computing Security Policy\n\n## Purpose\nThis policy establishes security requirements and best practices for the design, development, deployment, and operation of serverless computing environments. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data while enabling secure serverless adoption across the organization.\n\n## Scope\nThis policy applies to all serverless functions, event-driven architectures, and supporting infrastructure deployed on cloud platforms including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and equivalent services.\n\n## Security Principles\n\n### 1. Least Privilege Access\n- **Function Permissions:** Serverless functions must be granted only the minimum permissions required for their specific tasks\n- **IAM Roles:** Use granular IAM roles with principle of least privilege for function execution\n- **Runtime Permissions:** Avoid broad permissions; use temporary, scoped credentials when possible\n\n### 2. Secure Code Practices\n- **Input Validation:** All function inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks\n- **Secure Dependencies:** Use only vetted, up-to-date libraries with no known vulnerabilities\n- **Code Reviews:** All serverless code must undergo security-focused code reviews before deployment\n- **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets; use secure parameter stores or key management services\n\n### 3. Data Protection\n- **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive data stored by functions must be encrypted using platform-native encryption\n- **Encryption in Transit:** Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all data transmission\n- **Data Classification:** Classify data and apply appropriate protection levels based on sensitivity\n- **Data Minimization:** Collect and process only necessary data for function operations\n\n### 4. Network Security\n- **VPC Integration:** Deploy functions within secure VPCs when accessing private resources\n- **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict network access controls and security groups\n- **API Gateway Security:** Use API Gateway features like throttling, authentication, and request validation\n- **DDoS Protection:** Enable platform DDoS protection services for public-facing functions\n\n## Authentication and Authorization\n\n### Function Authentication\n- **API Keys:** Use short-lived API keys for service-to-service authentication\n- **OAuth/JWT:** Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user-facing function authentication\n- **Mutual TLS:** Require mutual TLS for high-security service communications\n- **Zero Trust:** Assume no implicit trust; verify all requests explicitly\n\n### Authorization Controls\n- **Role-Based Access:** Implement role-based access control for function invocation\n- **Attribute-Based Access:** Use attribute-based access control for fine-grained permissions\n- **Policy Enforcement:** Enforce authorization policies at the function level\n- **Audit Logging:** Log all authorization decisions for compliance and forensics\n\n## Monitoring and Logging\n\n### Security Monitoring\n- **Real-time Alerts:** Implement alerts for suspicious activities and security events\n- **Anomaly Detection:** Use AI/ML for detecting anomalous function behavior\n- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor for performance degradation that may indicate attacks\n- **Compliance Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness\n\n### Logging Requirements\n- **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all function invocations, errors, and security events\n- **Structured Logs:** Use structured logging formats for easy analysis and correlation\n- **Log Retention:** Retain logs for minimum 1 year or as required by compliance\n- **Log Security:** Protect log data with encryption and access controls\n- **Log Analysis:** Implement automated log analysis for threat detection\n\n## Incident Response\n\n### Incident Detection\n- **Automated Detection:** Use monitoring tools to automatically detect security

authorities\n- **NOTAM Compliance:** Adherence to Notice to Air Missions and temporary flight restrictions\n\n### Operational Safety Protocols\n- **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) Operations:** Pilot maintains continuous visual contact with aircraft\n- **Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) Operations:** Approved operations with enhanced safety systems and chase aircraft\n- **Geofencing:** Automated geographic restrictions preventing entry into restricted airspace\n- **Altitude Restrictions:** Compliance with maximum operating altitudes and controlled airspace boundaries\n\n### Crew and Personnel Standards\n- **Pilot Certification:** FAA Part 107 certification with additional organization-specific training\n- **Medical Fitness:** Annual medical examinations and substance testing for all operational personnel\n- **Proficiency Requirements:** Regular flight proficiency checks and emergency procedure training\n- **Fatigue Management:** Duty time limitations and rest requirements for flight crews\n\n## Maintenance and Quality Assurance\n- **Scheduled Maintenance:** Regular inspection and testing of all safety-critical systems and components\n- **Component Tracking:** Lifecycle management with replacement scheduling based on usage and condition\n- **Software Integrity:** Controlled software updates with comprehensive testing and validation\n- **Quality Control:** Independent inspection and testing of maintenance activities\n\n## Emergency Response and Contingency\n- **Loss of Control Procedures:** Immediate termination of flight with controlled recovery protocols\n- **Communications Failure:** Automatic activation of emergency procedures and ground team notification\n- **Airspace Incursion Response:** Coordinated procedures for encounters with manned aircraft\n- **Post-Incident Investigation:** Comprehensive analysis of all safety incidents with corrective action implementation\n\n## Regulatory Compliance and Documentation\n- **FAA Regulations:** Compliance with 14 CFR Part 107 and evolving unmanned aircraft system regulations\n- **Airspace Restrictions:** Adherence to controlled airspace, airport operations, and special use airspace\n- **Operations Manual:** Comprehensive documentation of all safety procedures and operational protocols\n- **Incident Reporting:** Mandatory reporting of all safety incidents within 24 hours\n\n## Technology and Data Management\n- **Flight Data Recording:** Comprehensive data collection for all operations with post-flight analysis\n- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time system health monitoring with automated alerts\n- **Remote Identification:** Broadcast of aircraft identification and location for public safety\n- **Cybersecurity Measures:** Protection of control systems and data links from unauthorized access\n\n## Training and Competency\n- **Initial Training:** Comprehensive safety training for all personnel involved in UAV operations\n- **Recurrent Training:** Annual refresher training covering regulatory changes and safety updates\n- **Emergency Training:** Regular simulation exercises for various emergency scenarios\n- **Evaluator Programs:** Independent assessment of pilot and crew competency\n\n## Continuous Safety Improvement\n- **Safety Performance Monitoring:** Regular review of safety metrics and incident trends\n- **Technology Advancement:** Integration of emerging safety technologies and industry best practices\n- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Regular consultation with regulators, aviation authorities, and industry partners\n- **Safety Culture Development:** Ongoing awareness programs and safety recognition initiatives\n\n## Policy Administration\n- **Safety Committee:** Quarterly meetings to review safety performance and implement improvements\n- **Annual Review:** Comprehensive policy review with updates based on regulatory changes and operational experience\n- **Change Management:** Controlled process for policy updates with stakeholder notification and training\n- **Audit and Compliance:** Regular internal audits and external regulatory compliance verification\n\n## Accountability and Enforcement\n- **Management Responsibility:** Clear accountability for safety compliance at all organizational levels\n- **Incident Investigation:** Independent investigation of safety incidents with corrective action tracking\n- **Performance Metrics:** Safety performance indicators with trend analysis and improvement targets\n- **Recognition Program:** Safety excellence awards and incentive programs for outstanding safety performance\n", "category": "policies", "industry": "aerospace", "file_path": "policies/aerospace_uav_operations_safety_policy.md"}
