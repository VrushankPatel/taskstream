# Agriculture Climate Resilient Yield Metrics Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard tracks the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies in maintaining and improving agricultural yields under varying weather conditions.

## Key Performance Indicators

### Yield Stability Metrics
- **Yield Variability Index**: Measures consistency of crop yields across seasons
  - Target: <15% variation
  - Current: 12%
  - Trend: Improving (down from 18% last year)

- **Drought Impact Score**: Percentage yield loss during drought conditions
  - Target: <20% loss
  - Current: 15%
  - Trend: Stable

### Climate Adaptation Effectiveness
- **Irrigation Efficiency**: Water usage per unit of yield
  - Target: 1.2 liters/kg
  - Current: 1.1 liters/kg
  - Trend: Improving

- **Resilient Crop Adoption Rate**: Percentage of acreage planted with drought-resistant varieties
  - Target: 70%
  - Current: 65%
  - Trend: Increasing

### Economic Impact Metrics
- **Revenue per Hectare**: Financial return accounting for climate-related losses
  - Target: $2,500/ha
  - Current: $2,450/ha
  - Trend: Stable

- **Adaptation ROI**: Return on investment for climate resilience initiatives
  - Target: 25% annual return
  - Current: 22%
  - Trend: Positive
