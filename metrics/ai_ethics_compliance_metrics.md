## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs
1. **Ethics Compliance Index**: Composite score combining review completion, bias mitigation, and incident rates
2. **AI Trust Score**: External stakeholder perception of ethical AI practices
3. **Bias Mitigation Effectiveness**: Reduction in biased outcomes across all AI systems

### Secondary KPIs
1. **Training Impact**: Correlation between training completion and reduced ethics incidents
2. **Process Efficiency**: Ethics review time without sacrificing quality
3. **Transparency Achievement**: Percentage of AI systems meeting explainability standards

## Reporting Cadence
- **Weekly**: Incident tracking and urgent compliance issues
- **Monthly**: Review process metrics and training completion
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive compliance audit and stakeholder surveys
- **Annually**: Full ethics program review and strategic planning

## Risk Indicators
- **Ethics Review Backlog**: >20% of projects delayed triggers resource review
- **Bias Incident Rate**: >5% increase from baseline requires immediate investigation
- **Training Non-Compliance**: >10% of staff incomplete triggers escalation
- **Regulatory Findings**: Any major non-compliance requires executive review

## Benchmarking
