# Automotive Supply Chain Performance Metrics Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This dashboard monitors the performance of the automotive supply chain, focusing on delivery reliability, quality metrics, cost efficiency, and supplier performance across tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Delivery Performance Metrics
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: 96.2% (Target: > 98%)
  - Percentage of supplier deliveries arriving on scheduled date
  - Critical for just-in-time manufacturing operations
  - Current: Below target due to transportation delays and supplier capacity issues

- **Perfect Order Rate**: 92.8% (Target: > 95%)
  - Percentage of orders delivered complete, on time, and damage-free
  - Includes all order components and documentation accuracy
  - Gap: 2.2% below target primarily from packaging and documentation issues

### Quality Metrics
- **Defect Rate (PPM)**: 850 (Target: < 500)
  - Parts per million defective components received
  - Measures supplier quality control effectiveness
  - Current: Above target due to material quality variations

- **Supplier Quality Score**: 8.1/10 (Target: > 9.0)
  - Overall quality rating based on defect rates, audit results, and improvement initiatives
  - Weighted average across all active suppliers
  - Gap: Quality improvement programs needed for 15% of suppliers

### Cost Efficiency Metrics
- **Supply Chain Cost as % of Sales**: 68.2% (Target: < 65%)
  - Total supply chain costs relative to revenue
  - Includes material costs, logistics, and supplier management
  - Current: Above target due to raw material price inflation

- **Supplier Cost Variance**: +3.2% (Target: Â±2%)
  - Variance from budgeted supplier costs
  - Tracks cost control and negotiation effectiveness
  - Current: Slight overrun due to global market conditions

### Supplier Performance Metrics
- **Supplier Development Index**: 7.4/10 (Target: > 8.5)
  - Measure of supplier capability improvement and collaboration
  - Based on joint improvement projects and knowledge sharing
  - Current: Good progress but more joint development needed

- **Supplier Risk Score**: 6.8/10 (Target: > 8.0)
  - Assessment of supplier financial stability and operational risk
  - Includes financial health, geographic diversification, and business continuity
  - Gap: 25% of suppliers have elevated risk scores

### Inventory Management Metrics
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 12.3 (Target: > 15)
  - Number of times inventory is sold and replaced annually
  - Indicates efficiency of inventory management
  - Current: Below target due to supply chain uncertainty

- **Days Sales Outstanding**: 28 days (Target: < 25)
  - Average time to collect payment from customers
  - Impacts working capital and cash flow
  - Current: Within acceptable range

## Trend Analysis
- **12-Month Trend**: Improving delivery performance (+2.1%) but quality metrics declining (-8.5%)
- **Cost Outlook**: Increasing pressure from material costs and transportation expenses
- **Risk Profile**: Stable supplier base but increasing concentration risk in critical components

## Supplier Segmentation
- **Tier 1 Suppliers (25)**: 97% on-time delivery, 720 PPM defects
- **Tier 2 Suppliers (150)**: 95% on-time delivery, 950 PPM defects
- **Tier 3 Suppliers (400)**: 94% on-time delivery, 1100 PPM defects

## Action Items
1. Implement supplier quality improvement programs for bottom 20% performers
2. Negotiate cost reduction initiatives with key suppliers
3. Diversify supplier base to reduce concentration risk
4. Invest in supply chain visibility technologies
5. Conduct quarterly supplier performance reviews and development planning
