# Climate Change Adaptation Performance Metrics Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This dashboard tracks organizational performance in adapting to climate change impacts, measuring resilience, risk mitigation, and sustainability initiatives across operations, supply chain, and facilities management.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Risk Assessment Metrics
- **Climate Risk Exposure Score**: 7.2/10 (Target: < 6.0)
  - Measures vulnerability to climate-related disruptions
  - Calculated based on geographical exposure, asset locations, and historical weather events
  - Current: High exposure in coastal facilities and agricultural supply chain

- **Adaptation Readiness Index**: 68% (Target: > 80%)
  - Percentage of critical operations with climate adaptation plans
  - Includes backup power systems, flood protection, and supply chain diversification
  - Gap: 32% of facilities lack comprehensive adaptation measures

### Operational Resilience Metrics
- **Business Continuity Success Rate**: 94% (Target: > 95%)
  - Percentage of climate-related disruptions managed without significant operational impact
  - Tracks recovery time and cost overruns during extreme weather events
  - YTD: Successfully managed 3 major weather disruptions

- **Supply Chain Disruption Frequency**: 0.8 events/month (Target: < 0.5)
  - Number of supply chain interruptions caused by climate events
  - Includes transportation delays, supplier facility damage, and raw material shortages
  - Trend: Increasing due to more frequent extreme weather

### Sustainability Performance Metrics
- **Carbon Reduction Achievement**: 78% of 2025 target (Target: 100%)
  - Progress toward annual carbon emission reduction goals
  - Measures Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions across operations
  - Current: On track for 85% achievement by year-end

- **Renewable Energy Usage**: 45% (Target: > 60%)
  - Percentage of total energy consumption from renewable sources
  - Includes solar, wind, and bioenergy across facilities
  - Gap: 15% below target due to grid dependency in remote locations

### Financial Impact Metrics
- **Climate-Related Loss Ratio**: 2.1% (Target: < 2.0%)
  - Percentage of revenue impacted by climate-related events
  - Includes direct losses, recovery costs, and business interruption
  - Current: Within acceptable range but trending upward

- **Adaptation Investment ROI**: 1.8x (Target: > 2.0x)
  - Return on investment for climate adaptation initiatives
  - Measures cost savings from avoided disruptions vs. adaptation spending
  - Current: Strong ROI on flood protection and backup power systems

### Stakeholder Metrics
- **Employee Climate Awareness**: 82% (Target: > 90%)
  - Percentage of employees trained on climate risks and adaptation procedures
  - Includes emergency preparedness and sustainability practices
  - Gap: Focus needed on field operations and remote workers

- **Community Impact Score**: 7.8/10 (Target: > 8.5)
  - External stakeholder assessment of climate adaptation efforts
  - Based on community surveys and NGO evaluations
  - Current: Strong performance in local disaster response

## Trend Analysis
- **12-Month Trend**: Improving adaptation readiness (+12%) but increasing disruption frequency (+15%)
- **Risk Outlook**: Medium-term risk reduction achieved, but extreme weather events testing resilience
- **Investment Impact**: Adaptation investments showing clear ROI in reduced downtime and costs

## Action Items
1. Accelerate facility adaptation plans for remaining 32% of locations
2. Diversify supply chain to reduce climate vulnerability
3. Increase renewable energy adoption to meet 60% target
4. Enhance employee training programs for climate preparedness
5. Monitor and report quarterly on all KPIs to executive leadership
