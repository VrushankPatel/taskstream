# Mining Operational Efficiency Metrics Dashboard

## Executive Summary
This dashboard tracks key operational efficiency metrics for mining operations, focusing on productivity, cost management, and resource utilization across all sites.

## Core Efficiency Metrics

### Production Efficiency
- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**
  - Target: >85%
  - Formula: Availability × Performance × Quality
  - Weekly tracking with equipment-specific breakdowns

- **Material Movement Rate**
  - Target: >95% of planned movements completed
  - Measures efficiency of ore/waste movement between stockpiles and crushers
  - Daily monitoring with bottleneck identification

- **Shift Utilization**
  - Target: >90% productive time per shift
  - Excludes breaks, safety meetings, and equipment downtime
  - Tracked by crew and equipment type

### Cost Management
- **Cost per Tonne Mined**
  - Target: <Industry benchmark by 10%
  - Includes labor, equipment, explosives, and maintenance
  - Monthly variance analysis by cost category

- **Maintenance Cost as % of Asset Value**
  - Target: <3% annually
  - Preventive vs. corrective maintenance ratio (>70% preventive)
  - Equipment age and utilization correlations

- **Energy Consumption per Tonne**
  - Target: 5% annual reduction
  - Tracked by process stage (drilling, blasting, crushing, grinding)
  - Carbon intensity calculations

### Resource Utilization
- **Labor Productivity**
  - Tonnes per employee hour
  - Target: Industry top quartile
  - Skill level and experience correlations

- **Equipment Utilization**
  - Hours operated vs. available hours
  - Target: >80% for critical equipment
  - Downtime categorization (planned vs. unplanned)

- **Inventory Turnover**
  - Raw materials and spare parts
  - Target: 6-8 turns annually
  - Carrying cost optimization

## Safety Integration Metrics
- **Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR)**
  - Target: <Industry average
  - Correlation with efficiency metrics to ensure safety/efficiency balance

## Environmental Efficiency
- **Water Usage per Tonne**
  - Target: 20% reduction from baseline
  - Recycling rates and treatment efficiency

- **Waste Rock Ratio**
  - Ore to waste ratio optimization
  - Mine planning effectiveness indicator
