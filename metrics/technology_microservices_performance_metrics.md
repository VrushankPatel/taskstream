# Microservices Architecture Performance Metrics Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard monitors the performance, reliability, and efficiency of our microservices-based platform, ensuring optimal system health and user experience.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### System Reliability Metrics

#### Availability and Uptime
- **Service Uptime**: Percentage of time services are operational (Target: > 99.9%)
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average time between service failures
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to restore service after failure (Target: < 15 minutes)
- **Service Level Agreements (SLA) Compliance**: Percentage meeting uptime guarantees

#### Error and Failure Rates
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests (Target: < 1%)
- **5xx Error Rate**: Percentage of server errors (Target: < 0.1%)
- **Circuit Breaker Trips**: Number of automatic failure preventions
- **Rollback Frequency**: Number of production rollbacks per month (Target: < 5)

### Performance Metrics

#### Response Time and Latency
- **P95 Response Time**: 95th percentile response time (Target: < 200ms)
- **P99 Response Time**: 99th percentile response time (Target: < 500ms)
- **Average Response Time**: Mean response time across all services
- **API Latency**: Time for inter-service communications (Target: < 50ms)

#### Throughput and Scalability
- **Requests Per Second (RPS)**: Average and peak request handling capacity
- **Concurrent Users**: Maximum supported concurrent users
- **Auto-scaling Efficiency**: Time to scale up/down under load
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage per service

### Development and Deployment Metrics

#### Deployment Performance
- **Deployment Frequency**: Number of deployments per day (Target: > 10)
- **Deployment Time**: Average time for deployment completion (Target: < 30 minutes)
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments (Target: > 95%)
- **Rollback Time**: Time to rollback failed deployments (Target: < 10 minutes)

#### Development Efficiency
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from code commit to production deployment (Target: < 1 hour)
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of changes requiring remediation (Target: < 15%)
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests (Target: > 80%)
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Ratio of refactoring time to new development time
