# Agile Development Team Structure

## Overview
Modern software development organization following Scrum framework with cross-functional teams optimized for rapid delivery and continuous improvement.

## Leadership Structure

### Executive Level
- **VP Engineering** - Oversees all engineering functions, sets technical strategy
- **Chief Technology Officer** - Defines technology roadmap, ensures architectural consistency

### Department Level
- **Engineering Director** - Manages multiple development teams, coordinates resource allocation
- **DevOps Director** - Leads infrastructure and deployment practices
- **Quality Assurance Director** - Establishes testing standards and automation

## Team Organization

### Squad Structure (Cross-functional Teams)
Each squad consists of 6-8 members with end-to-end responsibility for specific product features.

#### Squad Composition
- **Product Owner** (1) - Defines requirements, prioritizes backlog, represents business stakeholders
- **Scrum Master** (1) - Facilitates processes, removes impediments, coaches team
- **Senior Developer** (1-2) - Technical leadership, code reviews, mentoring
- **Developers** (3-4) - Full-stack development, testing, deployment
- **QA Engineer** (1) - Automated testing, manual validation, quality assurance
- **UX Designer** (0.5-1) - User experience design, prototyping

### Chapter Structure (Specialized Communities)
Cross-team communities of practice for knowledge sharing and standards.

#### Development Chapter
- Frontend Chapter Lead
- Backend Chapter Lead
- Mobile Chapter Lead
- DevOps Chapter Lead

#### Quality Chapter
- Test Automation Lead
- Performance Testing Lead
- Security Testing Lead

## Support Functions

### Platform Team
- Infrastructure management
- CI/CD pipeline maintenance
- Security tooling
- Monitoring and alerting

### Architecture Guild
- Enterprise architects
- Solution architects
- Technical standards committee

### Centers of Excellence
- AI/ML Center
- Cloud Architecture Center
- Security Center

## Communication and Collaboration

### Daily Standups
- 15-minute daily sync within squads
- Focus on progress, blockers, and next steps

### Sprint Ceremonies

## Performance Metrics

### Team Level
- Sprint velocity
- Sprint goal completion rate
- Code quality metrics (coverage, technical debt)
- Customer satisfaction scores

### Individual Level
- Code review participation
- Knowledge sharing contributions
- Mentoring activities
- Professional development goals

### Organizational Level
- Time-to-market for features

## Career Progression

### Individual Contributor Track
- Junior Developer → Senior Developer → Principal Developer → Staff Engineer

### Management Track
- Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → Senior Manager → Director

### Specialist Track
- Domain Expert → Senior Specialist → Principal Specialist

## Scaling Considerations

### Team Size Optimization
- Maximum 8 members per squad to maintain communication effectiveness
- Squad autonomy balanced with organizational alignment

### Coordination Mechanisms
- Communities of practice for cross-team collaboration
- Regular sync meetings between dependent squads
- Shared tooling and standards

This structure supports rapid innovation while maintaining quality and scalability across a growing engineering organization.
