Assistant: Good. Next, metrics/manufacturing_supply_chain_performance_metrics.md

Read first. 

From the list, there is supply_chain_performance_metrics.md, but not manufacturing_supply_chain_performance_metrics.md

Let me check. 

grep "manufacturing_supply_chain_performance" in metrics. 

From the list, there is supply_chain_performance_metrics.md, but not the manufacturing one. 

Write.
