# Advanced Robotics Collaborative Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety standards and protocols for the design, implementation, and operation of collaborative robotics systems in manufacturing and industrial environments. The policy ensures human-robot interaction safety while maximizing operational efficiency and productivity.

## Scope
Applies to all collaborative robot installations, maintenance activities, programming, and operations across all company facilities. Covers traditional industrial robots with collaborative features and purpose-built cobots.

## Policy Principles

### 1. Safety-First Design Philosophy
- All collaborative robot systems must incorporate multiple layers of safety measures
- Risk assessments must be conducted for every collaborative application
- Safety systems must be designed to fail safely and prevent harm
- Human safety takes precedence over production efficiency in all design decisions

### 2. Human-Centric Operation
- Collaborative robots must be designed for safe human-robot interaction
- Operators must receive comprehensive training on collaborative robot operation
- Clear communication protocols must be established for human-robot workspaces
- Emergency stop systems must be accessible and functional at all times

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
- All systems must comply with ISO 10218-1/2, ISO/TS 15066, and relevant OSHA standards
- Regular safety audits and certifications must be maintained
- Incident reporting and investigation protocols must follow regulatory requirements
- Documentation must support regulatory inspections and compliance audits

## Risk Assessment Requirements

### Pre-Installation Assessment
- Comprehensive risk analysis for each collaborative application
- Identification of potential hazards including crushing, shearing, impact, and entanglement
- Evaluation of human factors including fatigue, distraction, and training levels
- Assessment of environmental factors such as lighting, noise, and space constraints

### Ongoing Risk Management
- Regular reassessment of risks as applications evolve
- Monitoring of near-miss incidents and safety performance metrics
- Continuous improvement of safety measures based on incident data
- Integration of safety considerations in system upgrades and modifications
