# Advanced Robotics Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety standards and procedures for the design, deployment, and operation of advanced robotics systems to ensure the protection of human workers, equipment, and facilities.

## Scope
Applies to all robotics systems, collaborative robots (cobots), autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), and AI-driven automation systems deployed across all company facilities and operations.

## Safety Principles

### 1. Human-Centric Design
- All robotics systems must incorporate human safety as the primary design consideration
- Risk assessments must be conducted using ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-1/2 standards
- Safety functions must be fail-safe and redundant

### 2. Collaborative Operation Standards
- Cobots must operate at speeds and forces that minimize injury risk
- Safety-rated monitored stop (SMS) and protective stop (PS) functions required
- Minimum separation distances must be maintained based on robot speed and stopping time

### 3. Autonomous System Requirements
- Autonomous robots must have comprehensive environmental awareness systems
- Emergency stop capabilities must be accessible within 10 seconds
- Failsafe behaviors must return systems to safe states upon any malfunction

## Risk Assessment and Management

### Pre-Deployment Assessment
- Comprehensive risk analysis required for all new robotics installations
- Third-party safety certification mandatory for high-risk applications
- Human factors engineering assessment required for collaborative workspaces

### Ongoing Risk Monitoring
- Regular safety audits conducted quarterly
- Incident reporting and investigation within 24 hours
- Performance metrics tracked for safety system effectiveness

## Safety System Requirements

### Physical Safety Measures
- Safety light curtains and laser scanners for collaborative zones
- Emergency stop buttons accessible within 2 meters of all robot operations
- Physical barriers and interlocks for high-risk areas
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements clearly marked

### Control System Safety
- Safety PLCs with dual-channel architecture
- Redundant safety sensors and actuators
- Real-time monitoring and logging of safety system status
- Automatic system shutdown upon safety system failure

### Software Safety
- Formal verification and validation of safety-critical software
- Cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized system access
- Regular software updates with safety impact assessments

## Training and Competency

### Operator Training
- Comprehensive training required for all personnel working with robots
- Refresher training annually and after any system modifications
- Competency assessments documented and maintained

### Maintenance Personnel
- Specialized training for robotics maintenance and repair
- Lockout/tagout procedures strictly enforced
- Emergency response training for robotics incidents

## Incident Response and Investigation

### Reporting Requirements
- All safety incidents must be reported immediately
- Near-miss events documented and investigated
- Root cause analysis conducted within 72 hours

### Response Protocol
- Immediate cessation of unsafe operations
- Medical attention prioritized for any injuries
- System isolation and forensic analysis of incidents
- Corrective action implementation within 30 days

## Continuous Improvement

### Safety Performance Metrics
- Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) tracked monthly
- Safety system availability monitored continuously
- Training completion rates audited quarterly

### Review and Updates
- Annual policy review and update
- Incorporation of lessons learned from incidents
- Adoption of emerging safety standards and technologies

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Safety Committee
- Cross-functional team led by Chief Safety Officer
- Quarterly reviews of safety performance
- Approval authority for high-risk robotics deployments

### Department Heads
- Ensure compliance within their areas
- Report safety concerns immediately
- Support incident investigations

### Employees
- Follow all safety procedures and protocols
- Report unsafe conditions or behaviors
- Participate in required training programs

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Regulatory Compliance
- Adherence to OSHA, ANSI, and ISO robotics safety standards
- Regular audits by external safety certification bodies
- Documentation maintained for regulatory inspections

### Non-Compliance Consequences
- Verbal warning for minor violations
- Written warning and retraining for repeated violations
- Disciplinary action up to termination for serious violations
- System shutdown for critical safety failures
