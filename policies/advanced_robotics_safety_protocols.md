# Advanced Robotics Safety Protocols Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety protocols for the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of collaborative robotics systems in manufacturing environments. The goal is to ensure safe human-robot interaction while maximizing operational efficiency and productivity.

## Scope
This policy applies to all facilities implementing or operating collaborative robotics systems, including employees, contractors, visitors, and maintenance personnel.

## Safety Principles

### Hierarchy of Controls
1. **Elimination:** Remove hazardous conditions where possible  
2. **Substitution:** Replace hazardous processes with safer alternatives  
3. **Engineering Controls:** Implement safety systems and barriers  
4. **Administrative Controls:** Establish procedures and training  
5. **Personal Protective Equipment:** Provide appropriate PPE as last line of defense  

### Human-Robot Collaboration
1. **Collaborative Operation Zones**  
   - Clearly defined areas where humans and robots work together  
   - Speed and force limitations in collaborative zones  
   - Real-time monitoring of human presence
