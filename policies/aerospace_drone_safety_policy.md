# Aerospace Drone Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety standards for the operation, maintenance, and integration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) within aerospace operations to ensure safe airspace management and protect public safety.

## Scope
Applies to all drone operations including research, testing, commercial operations, and integration with manned aviation systems. Covers design, operation, maintenance, and regulatory compliance.

## Policy Statement
We are committed to the highest standards of safety in unmanned aerial systems operations. All drone activities must prioritize public safety, airspace security, and seamless integration with existing aviation infrastructure.
