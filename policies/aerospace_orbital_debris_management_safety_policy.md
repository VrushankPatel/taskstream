# Aerospace Orbital Debris Management Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes safety protocols and operational procedures for managing orbital debris risks in satellite deployment, operations, and end-of-life disposal to ensure space situational awareness and collision avoidance.

## Scope
Applies to all satellite programs, launch operations, and orbital missions conducted by the company, including commercial, government, and international partnerships.

## Orbital Debris Risk Management

### Pre-Launch Assessment
- **Debris Environment Analysis**: Conduct comprehensive assessment of orbital debris population in target orbits
- **Collision Risk Evaluation**: Calculate probability of collision with tracked objects >10cm
- **Conjunction Assessment**: Monitor close approaches within 1 km for objects >1cm
- **Launch Window Optimization**: Select launch times minimizing debris encounter risks

### Satellite Design Requirements
- **Design for Demise**: Incorporate design features ensuring satellite breakup and burn-up upon reentry
- **Collision Avoidance Maneuvering**: Equip satellites with propulsion systems for collision avoidance
- **Tracking and Identification**: Include radar-reflective surfaces and transponders for space surveillance
- **Modular Design**: Enable partial deorbiting and controlled reentry of satellite components

## Operational Safety Protocols

### Mission Planning
- **Orbital Lifetime Limitation**: Design missions with maximum 25-year orbital lifetime
- **Deorbit Planning**: Develop end-of-life deorbit plans during mission design phase
- **Backup Systems**: Include redundant collision avoidance and deorbit capabilities
- **International Coordination**: Coordinate with international space agencies for shared orbits

### Real-Time Operations
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Maintain 24/7 monitoring of satellite conjunctions

- **Maneuver Planning**: Develop contingency maneuver plans for high-risk conjunctions
- **Communication Protocols**: Establish clear communication chains for collision avoidance decisions

### Collision Avoidance Procedures
- **Risk Assessment Thresholds**:
  - Low Risk (<1:100,000): Monitor only
  - Medium Risk (1:10,000 to 1:100,000): Prepare maneuver plan
  - High Risk (>1:10,000): Execute avoidance maneuver within 24 hours
- **Maneuver Execution**: Conduct collision avoidance burns with minimum delta-V requirements
- **Post-Maneuver Verification**: Confirm successful orbit changes and update tracking systems

### Graveyard Orbit Management
- **Geostationary Disposal**: Place GEO satellites in graveyard orbits 300 km above operational altitude
- **LEO Deorbit Requirements**: Ensure LEO satellites deorbit within 25 years of mission completion
- **Orbit Maintenance**: Monitor and maintain disposal orbits to prevent interference with operational satellites
- **Long-term Monitoring**: Track disposed satellites for orbital decay and potential reentry

## Regulatory Compliance

### International Standards
