- **National Aviation Authorities**: Country-specific operating permissions
- **Military Coordination**: Restricted airspace awareness and coordination

## Safety Management System Requirements

### Risk Assessment Protocol
1. **Pre-Flight Risk Assessment**: Mandatory for all operations
   - Weather condition evaluation
   - Airspace conflict analysis
   - Ground risk assessment
   - Emergency contingency planning

2. **Operational Risk Mitigation**:
   - Geo-fencing system requirements
   - Real-time tracking and telemetry
   - Automatic return-to-home capabilities
   - Fail-safe system redundancies

### Personnel Qualifications
- **Remote Pilot Certification**: EASA Part-SPO qualification required

- **Training Requirements**: 40 hours initial training, 20 hours annual recurrent training
- **Competency Assessment**: Practical evaluation every 12 months

## Operational Safety Standards

### Flight Operations
- **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)**: Maximum range 500 meters for operations without special authorization
- **Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)**: Requires specific risk assessment and authorization
- **Maximum Altitude**: 120 meters above ground level for standard operations
- **Speed Limitations**: 50 knots maximum for urban operations

### Equipment Standards
- **Certification Requirements**: CE marking for EU operations
- **Maintenance Intervals**: 50-hour inspection cycle for all systems
- **Software Updates**: Mandatory security patches within 30 days
- **Data Recording**: Black box equivalent for all flights over 10 minutes

### Emergency Procedures
- **Loss of Control**: Automatic landing protocols
- **Communication Failure**: Contingency communication systems
- **System Malfunction**: Immediate termination procedures
- **Incident Reporting**: Within 24 hours to regulatory authorities

## Data Security and Privacy

### Information Protection
- **Flight Data Security**: Encrypted transmission and storage
- **Personal Data Handling**: GDPR compliance for passenger/cargo information
- **Cybersecurity Measures**: Multi-factor authentication for control systems
- **Data Retention**: 5-year retention for safety investigation purposes

### Privacy Considerations
- **Surveillance Restrictions**: No unauthorized data collection
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary operational data
- **Third-Party Access**: Restricted to authorized maintenance personnel

## Environmental Protection

### Noise Management
- **Noise Certification**: EASA noise standards compliance
- **Operating Hours**: Restricted operations during sensitive periods
- **Community Impact**: Pre-operation community notification for residential areas

### Wildlife Protection
- **Migratory Bird Awareness**: Seasonal operation restrictions
- **Wildlife Habitat Protection**: Minimum altitude requirements over protected areas
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Required for operations in sensitive ecosystems

## Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement

### Internal Controls
- **Safety Management System**: Annual audit and continuous monitoring
- **Incident Investigation**: Root cause analysis for all safety events
- **Corrective Action Tracking**: Implementation verification within 30 days
- **Performance Metrics**: Monthly safety KPI reporting

### External Oversight
- **Regulatory Inspections**: Unannounced compliance audits
- **Certification Renewal**: Annual recertification process
- **International Coordination**: Cross-border operation approvals

## Training and Awareness

### Personnel Development
- **Initial Training**: Comprehensive safety and operational training
- **Recurrent Training**: Annual refresher courses
- **Emergency Response**: Scenario-based training exercises
- **Technology Updates**: Training on new systems and procedures

### Organizational Culture

- **Reporting Culture**: Non-punitive incident reporting system
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular safety lessons learned sessions

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025)
- Policy publication and communication
- Initial training program rollout
- Equipment certification assessment

### Phase 2: Implementation (Q2-Q3 2025)
- System upgrades and modifications
- Personnel certification completion
- Operational procedure updates

### Phase 3: Optimization (Q4 2025+)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Continuous improvement processes
- Advanced technology integration

## Consequences of Non-Compliance
- **Minor Violations**: Verbal warning and corrective training
- **Serious Violations**: Suspension of operations and formal investigation
- **Critical Violations**: Permanent revocation of operating privileges
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Fines up to â‚¬500,000 and legal action

## Review and Update Process
