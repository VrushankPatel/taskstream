# Aerospace Unmanned Systems Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the safety requirements and operational guidelines for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), and autonomous systems within aerospace operations. The goal is to ensure safe integration of unmanned systems while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
This policy applies to all unmanned systems operations including:
- Research and development activities
- Test and evaluation flights
- Operational missions
- Maintenance and storage
- Third-party vendor operations

## Safety Principles

### Risk Management
1. **Risk Assessment**: All unmanned systems operations must undergo formal risk assessment prior to execution
2. **Safety Cases**: Complex operations require documented safety cases demonstrating adequate risk controls
3. **ALARP Principle**: Risks must be reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable levels

### Operational Controls
1. **Command and Control**: Maintain positive control of unmanned systems at all times
2. **Fail-Safe Systems**: All systems must have redundant fail-safe mechanisms
3. **Communication Links**: Secure and redundant communication systems required for command and telemetry

## Regulatory Compliance

### Certification Requirements
1. **FAA/EASA Compliance**: All UAS operations must comply with applicable aviation regulations
2. **Type Certification**: Unmanned systems must meet applicable airworthiness standards
3. **Operator Certification**: Personnel must hold appropriate licenses and certifications

### International Operations
1. **ICAO Standards**: International operations must comply with ICAO Annex 2 requirements
2. **Local Regulations**: Operations in foreign jurisdictions must obtain necessary authorizations
3. **Export Controls**: Unmanned systems technology transfers must comply with ITAR/EAR regulations

## Personnel Requirements

### Qualifications
1. **Pilot-in-Command**: Must hold FAA Part 107 certificate or equivalent
2. **Visual Observer**: Required for operations beyond visual line of sight
3. **Maintenance Personnel**: Must be certified for specific unmanned system types
4. **Safety Officers**: Designated safety personnel for high-risk operations

### Training
1. **Initial Training**: Comprehensive training on system operations and emergency procedures
2. **Recurrent Training**: Annual proficiency checks and safety refresher training
3. **Emergency Response**: Specialized training for system failures and recovery operations

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Flight Requirements
1. **System Checks**: Comprehensive pre-flight inspection and testing
2. **Weather Minimums**: Operations prohibited in adverse weather conditions
3. **NOTAM Review**: Current notice to airmen must be reviewed
4. **Airspace Coordination**: ATC coordination required for controlled airspace

### Flight Operations
1. **Operating Limits**: Strict adherence to manufacturer and regulatory limitations
2. **Contingency Planning**: Emergency procedures for all foreseeable failure modes
3. **Communication Protocols**: Standardized communication procedures during operations
4. **Post-Flight Review**: Mandatory debrief and incident reporting

## Safety Management System

### Incident Reporting
1. **Mandatory Reporting**: All incidents, accidents, and near-misses must be reported
2. **Investigation Process**: Formal investigation for all safety-related events
3. **Corrective Actions**: Implementation of corrective and preventive actions
4. **Trend Analysis**: Regular analysis of safety data for systemic improvements

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Safety Audits**: Regular audits of unmanned systems operations
2. **Lessons Learned**: Incorporation of lessons from industry incidents
3. **Technology Updates**: Regular review of safety technology advancements
4. **Training Updates**: Curriculum updates based on operational experience

## Equipment Standards

### System Requirements
1. **Redundancy**: Critical systems must have redundancy
2. **Fail-Safe Design**: Automatic return-to-home or landing capabilities
3. **Data Recording**: Flight data recording for incident investigation
4. **Geo-Fencing**: Geographic restrictions to prevent unauthorized operations

### Maintenance
1. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Regular maintenance according to manufacturer guidelines
2. **Condition Monitoring**: Health monitoring systems for predictive maintenance
3. **Calibration**: Regular calibration of sensors and navigation systems
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive maintenance records for regulatory compliance

## Emergency Response

### Incident Response
1. **Emergency Procedures**: Standardized procedures for system failures
2. **Recovery Operations**: Trained personnel for system recovery and retrieval
3. **Public Safety**: Procedures to ensure public safety during incidents
4. **Notification Requirements**: Immediate notification to regulatory authorities

### Crisis Management
1. **Crisis Response Team**: Designated team for major incidents
2. **Communication Plan**: Internal and external communication protocols
3. **Business Continuity**: Procedures to maintain operations during disruptions

## Enforcement and Compliance

### Monitoring
1. **Safety Oversight**: Independent safety oversight function
2. **Performance Metrics**: Regular monitoring of safety performance indicators
3. **Audit Program**: Comprehensive audit program for policy compliance

### Non-Compliance
1. **Disciplinary Actions**: Progressive discipline for policy violations
2. **Corrective Actions**: Mandatory corrective actions for non-compliance
3. **Reporting Requirements**: Regulatory reporting of serious violations

## Review and Revision
This policy will be reviewed annually or following significant incidents or regulatory changes. All revisions must be approved by the Safety Review Board.
