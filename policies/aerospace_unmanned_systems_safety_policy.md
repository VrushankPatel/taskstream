# Aerospace Unmanned Systems Safety Policy

## Policy Overview
**Effective Date:** 2025-03-01
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-01
**Policy Owner:** Chief Safety Officer
**Applies To:** All personnel involved in unmanned aerial systems (UAS), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), and autonomous systems operations

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety standards for the operation, maintenance, and deployment of unmanned systems to ensure public safety, operational security, and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
- All unmanned aerial systems (drones, UAVs)
- Unmanned ground vehicles and autonomous robotics
- Autonomous maritime systems
- Integration with manned operations
- Research, development, testing, and commercial operations

## Safety Principles

### 1. Operational Safety Standards
- Maintain minimum safe distances from populated areas and critical infrastructure
- Implement geo-fencing and no-fly zone restrictions
- Require visual line-of-sight operations for certain mission profiles
- Establish emergency landing protocols and fail-safe mechanisms

### 2. System Certification and Maintenance
- All unmanned systems must meet FAA/EASA certification requirements
- Regular maintenance and inspection schedules must be followed
- Pre-flight checklists mandatory for all operations
- Software updates and cybersecurity patches applied promptly

### 3. Personnel Qualifications
- Operators must hold appropriate certifications and licenses
- Regular proficiency testing and recurrent training required
- Medical fitness standards for operational personnel
- Background checks for security-sensitive operations

### 4. Risk Management
- Comprehensive risk assessments for all operations
- Weather minimums and operational limitations
- Contingency planning for system failures
- Incident reporting and investigation procedures

## Operational Protocols

### Pre-Flight Requirements
- Weather assessment and NOTAM review
- System functionality checks and calibration
- Communication system verification
- Emergency equipment readiness

### During Operations
- Continuous monitoring and communication
- Adherence to altitude and speed restrictions
- Immediate termination capability
- Real-time tracking and telemetry monitoring

### Post-Operation Procedures
- System inspection and maintenance logging
- Data download and analysis
- Incident debrief and lessons learned
- Equipment secure storage

## Emergency Response

### Incident Classification
- **Level 1**: Minor incidents with no injuries or property damage
- **Level 2**: Incidents with minor injuries or property damage under $10,000
- **Level 3**: Serious incidents with major injuries or significant damage

### Response Procedures
- Immediate cessation of operations
- Notification of appropriate authorities
- Preservation of evidence and data
- Internal investigation initiation

## Regulatory Compliance

### Certification Requirements
- FAA Part 107 certification for commercial operations
- EASA equivalent certifications for European operations
- Local aviation authority approvals where required
- Annual recertification and proficiency checks

### Documentation and Reporting
- Maintain comprehensive operational logs
- Report all incidents to regulatory authorities within 24 hours
- Annual safety performance reporting
- Audit trail for all system modifications

## Training and Awareness

- Annual recurrent training and evaluation
- Emergency procedure drills
- System-specific training for new equipment

### Safety Culture
- Regular safety briefings and toolbox talks
- Anonymous safety reporting system
- Recognition program for safety excellence
- Continuous improvement initiatives

## Technology and Equipment Standards

### System Requirements
- Redundant communication systems
- Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) capability
- Detect and avoid systems for beyond visual line-of-sight operations
- Encrypted data transmission and secure storage

### Maintenance Standards
