# Agriculture Carbon Credit Trading Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for participating in carbon credit markets, enabling agricultural operations to generate revenue from carbon sequestration and emission reduction activities while contributing to climate change mitigation.

## Scope
Applies to all agricultural lands, livestock operations, and farming practices that can generate carbon credits through sequestration or emission reductions.

## Enforcement
Carbon credit activities must maintain the highest standards of integrity and transparency. Any misrepresentation of carbon sequestration or emission reductions will result in immediate suspension of trading activities and potential legal action. Violations will be investigated by the Audit Committee with findings reported to executive leadership.
