# AI Ethics Bias Monitoring Framework Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for monitoring, detecting, and mitigating bias in AI systems deployed across healthcare, biotechnology, and other critical business functions.

## Scope
Applies to all AI systems, algorithms, and machine learning models developed, acquired, or operated by the organization, with particular emphasis on systems impacting patient care, clinical decisions, and human resources.

## Definitions

- **Bias:** Systematic errors in AI system outputs that disadvantage certain groups or individuals
- **Protected Characteristics:** Race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, socioeconomic status, geographic location
- **Bias Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of AI system performance across different demographic groups
- **Bias Mitigation:** Actions taken to reduce or eliminate identified biases

## Governance Structure
