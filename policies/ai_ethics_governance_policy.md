# AI Ethics Governance Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for ethical development, deployment, and governance of artificial intelligence systems at our organization. It ensures that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with our values and legal obligations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties involved in the development, deployment, maintenance, or use of AI systems within our organization.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human-Centric Design
AI systems must prioritize human well-being, dignity, and rights. All AI applications should:
- Enhance human capabilities rather than replace human judgment
- Respect individual privacy and autonomy
- Avoid harm to vulnerable populations
- Promote equitable outcomes across diverse user groups

### 2. Transparency & Explainability
AI decision-making processes must be transparent and understandable:
- Users should be informed when interacting with AI systems
- AI decisions should be explainable to affected stakeholders
- Technical documentation must be maintained and accessible
- Algorithmic bias and limitations must be clearly communicated

### 3. Accountability & Responsibility
Clear accountability for AI system outcomes is required:
- Designated responsible parties for each AI system
- Regular audits and performance monitoring
- Incident response procedures for AI failures
- Ethical review processes for high-risk applications

### 4. Fairness & Non-Discrimination
AI systems must promote fairness and avoid discrimination:
- Regular bias assessments and mitigation strategies
- Diverse representation in training data and development teams
- Equitable access to AI system benefits
- Protection against discriminatory outcomes

### 5. Privacy & Data Protection
AI systems must respect privacy and data rights:
- Lawful and ethical data collection practices
- Data minimization and purpose limitation
- Strong security measures for sensitive data
- User consent and control over personal data
