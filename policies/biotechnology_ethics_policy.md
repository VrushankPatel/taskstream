# Biotechnology Ethics Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes ethical principles and governance frameworks for biotechnology research, development, and commercialization activities to ensure responsible innovation that benefits society while minimizing potential harms.

## Scope
Applies to all biotechnology research, clinical development, and commercial activities involving genetic engineering, cell therapies, bioinformatics, and related technologies.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Beneficence and Non-Maleficence
- Primary commitment to maximizing benefits and minimizing harms
- Rigorous risk-benefit assessments for all research activities
- Continuous monitoring of unintended consequences

### 2. Justice and Equity
- Equitable access to biotechnological advancements
- Avoidance of discrimination in research and application
- Special consideration for vulnerable populations

### 3. Autonomy and Informed Consent
