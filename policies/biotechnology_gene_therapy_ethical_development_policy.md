# Biotechnology Gene Therapy Ethical Development Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the ethical framework for the research, development, and clinical application of gene therapy technologies at our biotechnology company. It ensures that all gene therapy programs prioritize patient safety, scientific integrity, societal benefit, and equitable access while maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and collaborators involved in gene therapy research, development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization activities.

## Ethical Principles

### 1. Patient Safety and Welfare
- **Primary Consideration:** Patient safety and well-being shall always take precedence over scientific or commercial objectives
- **Risk-Benefit Assessment:** All gene therapy programs must undergo rigorous risk-benefit analysis by independent ethics committees
- **Informed Consent:** Patients must receive comprehensive information about potential risks, benefits, and alternatives in clear, understandable language
- **Right to Withdraw:** Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time without penalty or impact on future care

### 2. Scientific Integrity and Transparency
- **Data Integrity:** All research data must be accurately recorded, maintained, and reported without manipulation or selective reporting
- **Publication Ethics:** Negative or inconclusive results must be published with the same rigor as positive findings
- **Conflict of Interest:** Researchers must disclose any financial or personal interests that could influence research outcomes
- **Peer Review:** All major findings undergo independent peer review before public disclosure

### 3. Equitable Access and Social Justice
- **Access Equity:** Gene therapies will be developed with consideration for global access, not just high-income markets
- **Pricing Ethics:** Pricing strategies must balance recovery of R&D costs with patient access and healthcare system sustainability
- **Diversity in Research:** Clinical trials must include diverse populations to ensure therapies work across different demographics
- **Community Engagement:** Local communities affected by research facilities will be engaged in decision-making processes

### 4. Germline and Heritable Editing
- **Prohibition:** Germline editing for reproductive purposes is strictly prohibited
- **Somatic Only:** All therapeutic applications are limited to somatic cell editing only
