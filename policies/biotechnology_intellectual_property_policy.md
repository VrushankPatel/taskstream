# Biotechnology Intellectual Property Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for the identification, protection, and management of intellectual property in biotechnology research and development, ensuring competitive advantage and compliance with legal requirements.

## Scope
Applies to all biotechnology-related inventions, discoveries, and proprietary information developed by employees, contractors, and collaborators.

## IP Ownership Principles

### Company Ownership
- All IP developed using company resources or during work hours belongs to the company
- Personal inventions unrelated to company business remain with the individual
- Joint inventions with external parties require clear ownership agreements

### Employee Obligations
- Disclose all potentially patentable inventions within 30 days
- Assign IP rights to the company through standard agreements
- Maintain confidentiality of proprietary information
- Participate in IP protection processes as required

## Invention Disclosure Process

### Initial Disclosure
1. **Researcher Notification:** Scientist identifies potentially patentable invention
2. **Disclosure Submission:** Complete invention disclosure form within 30 days
3. **Initial Review:** IP team assesses patentability and commercial potential
4. **Confidentiality Agreement:** Sign NDA if external disclosure needed

### Patent Evaluation
1. **Technical Assessment:** Evaluate novelty, non-obviousness, and utility
2. **Market Analysis:** Assess commercial potential and competitive landscape
3. **Freedom-to-Operate:** Review potential blocking patents
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Determine patent filing and maintenance costs

## Patent Protection Strategy

### Filing Decisions
- **Core Technology:** File in all major markets (US, EU, China, Japan)
- **Platform Technologies:** Comprehensive global protection
- **Product-Specific:** Strategic filing based on market potential
- **Defensive Publications:** Publish non-core inventions to prevent others from patenting

### International Protection
- **PCT Applications:** File within 12 months of priority application
- **Regional Patents:** EP, JP, CN patent filings
- **Cost Optimization:** Use patent cooperation programs and deferred examinations

## Trade Secret Protection

### Confidential Information
- Maintain trade secrets for commercially valuable information not patentable
- Implement technical and administrative safeguards
- Limit access to need-to-know basis
- Regular security audits and training

### Know-How Protection
- Document proprietary processes and methods
- Secure laboratory notebooks and digital records
- Implement clean room procedures for sensitive work

## Technology Transfer and Licensing

### Outbound Licensing
- Evaluate licensing opportunities for non-core technologies
- Negotiate fair royalty rates and milestone payments
- Maintain quality control over licensed technologies
- Monitor licensee compliance and performance

### Inbound Licensing
- Conduct thorough due diligence on licensed technologies
- Negotiate favorable terms including improvement rights
- Integrate licensed technologies into development programs
- Monitor license compliance and payment obligations

## IP in Collaborations and Partnerships

### Academic Collaborations
- Define IP ownership in research agreements
- Secure company rights to commercializable inventions
- Allow academic publication with appropriate delays
- Include option rights for further development

### Industry Partnerships
- Negotiate balanced IP terms based on contribution value
- Include joint ownership provisions for collaborative inventions
- Establish governance committees for IP management
- Plan for IP separation upon partnership dissolution

## IP Enforcement and Defense

### Patent Enforcement
- Monitor competitor activities and potential infringements
- Evaluate cost-benefit of enforcement actions
- Pursue licensing or litigation when appropriate
- Defend against infringement claims

### Defensive Strategies
- Build patent portfolios to deter litigation
- Cross-license with competitors when beneficial
- Participate in industry patent pools
- Maintain insurance coverage for IP disputes

## Compliance and Ethics

### Regulatory Compliance
- Adhere to patent laws in all jurisdictions
- Comply with export control regulations
- Follow ethical guidelines for genetic inventions
- Maintain accurate invention records

### Ethical Considerations
- Respect indigenous knowledge and traditional medicines
- Avoid patenting naturally occurring genes
- Consider access to medicines in developing countries
- Promote responsible use of genetic technologies

## Training and Awareness
- Mandatory IP training for all research and development staff
- Specialized training for IP professionals and legal counsel
- Regular updates on patent laws and best practices
- Awareness campaigns on IP protection importance

## Monitoring and Auditing
- Annual IP portfolio reviews
- Regular audits of IP management processes
- Compliance monitoring for policy adherence
- Performance metrics tracking for IP team effectiveness

## Review and Updates
- Annual policy review and updates
- Adaptation to changing patent laws and regulations
- Incorporation of new technologies and business models
- Feedback from legal and IP professionals
