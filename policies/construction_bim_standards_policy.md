# Construction BIM Standards and Implementation Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes standards for Building Information Modeling (BIM) implementation across all construction projects, ensuring consistent digital practices, collaboration, and information exchange.

## Scope
Applies to all projects implementing BIM, including design teams, construction personnel, subcontractors, and technology partners.

## BIM Philosophy
BIM is a collaborative process that produces and manages digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of buildings. We leverage BIM to improve project outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance collaboration.

## Management Commitment

### Executive Support
- BIM integrated into company strategic objectives
