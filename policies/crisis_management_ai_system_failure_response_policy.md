### Business Impact Assessment Team
- **Role**: Evaluate operational and financial impact of AI failure
- **Responsibilities**: Impact quantification, alternative process activation, recovery prioritization

## Incident Classification

### Level 1 (Minor)
- Impact: <1 hour downtime, <5% functionality loss
- Response: Local team resolution within 4 hours
- Notification: Technical team only

### Level 2 (Moderate)
- Impact: 1-4 hours downtime, 5-25% functionality loss
- Response: Crisis team activation, customer notification
- Notification: Executive team, affected business units

### Level 3 (Major)
- Impact: >4 hours downtime, >25% functionality loss
- Response: Full crisis protocol, public communication
- Notification: Board of directors, regulators, media

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-30 minutes)
1. Automated monitoring alerts trigger incident response
2. Initial assessment of failure scope and impact
3. Crisis team notification and assembly
4. System isolation to prevent further damage

### Phase 2: Containment and Recovery (30-120 minutes)
1. Activate backup systems and manual processes
2. Implement temporary workarounds
3. Begin root cause analysis
4. Communicate status to stakeholders

### Phase 3: Resolution and Recovery (2-24 hours)
1. Restore primary systems with fixes
2. Validate system functionality
3. Monitor for 24 hours post-recovery
4. Document incident and response

### Phase 4: Review and Prevention (1-4 weeks)
1. Conduct post-mortem analysis
2. Implement preventive measures
3. Update monitoring and response procedures
4. Train team on lessons learned

## Communication Protocols
