# Cybersecurity Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for protecting company information systems, data, and digital assets from cyber threats, ensuring business continuity and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties who access company systems, data, or networks.

## Core Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure
- Regular security assessments and testing

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Least privilege access
- Continuous monitoring and validation

### Risk-Based Approach
- Identify and prioritize critical assets
- Assess threats and vulnerabilities
- Implement appropriate controls

## Security Controls

### Access Management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all systems
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular access reviews and revocation
- Secure password policies

### Network Security
- Firewall and intrusion detection systems
- Network segmentation
- VPN for remote access
- Regular vulnerability scanning

### Endpoint Protection
- Antivirus and anti-malware software
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Device encryption
- Mobile device management (MDM)

### Data Protection
- Data classification and labeling
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Secure backup and recovery

### Application Security
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security testing
- Vulnerability management
- Third-party risk assessment

## Incident Response

### Detection and Analysis
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Automated alerting and monitoring
- Incident classification and prioritization
- Initial impact assessment

### Containment and Eradication
- Isolate affected systems
- Remove malicious code and backdoors
- Preserve evidence for investigation
- Implement temporary controls

### Recovery and Lessons Learned
- Restore systems from clean backups
- Monitor for reoccurrence
- Document incident and response
- Update controls and procedures

### Notification Requirements

### Security Audits
- Annual penetration testing
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Independent security audits

### Training and Awareness

- Contractual security requirements
- Ongoing monitoring and audits
- Incident notification obligations

### Supply Chain Security
- Secure software supply chain practices
- Open source vulnerability management
- Third-party component scanning

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Security Metrics
- Number of security incidents
- Mean time to detect (MTTD)
- Mean time to respond (MTTR)
- Security control effectiveness

### Reporting Structure
