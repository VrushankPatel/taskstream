# Data Governance Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for managing data as a strategic asset across the organization. It ensures data quality, security, privacy, and compliance while enabling data-driven decision making.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who collect, process, store, or access company data across all systems, applications, and locations.

## Policy Statement
Data is a critical business asset that must be managed with appropriate governance, security, and compliance controls. All data activities must align with business objectives while protecting privacy rights and ensuring regulatory compliance.
