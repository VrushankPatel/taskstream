# 6G Network Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the security framework for the development, deployment, and operation of 6G network infrastructure, ensuring the protection of network assets, user data, and national security interests.

## Scope
This policy applies to all 6G network components, including:
- Terahertz spectrum communications
- AI-driven network management systems
- Edge computing infrastructure
- IoT device ecosystems
- Quantum-resistant encryption systems

## Security Principles

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Default Deny:** All access requests are denied by default
- **Continuous Verification:** Identity and context verification for every access attempt
- **Micro-Segmentation:** Network divided into secure segments with granular access controls
- **Least Privilege:** Users and devices granted minimum necessary access

### AI-Driven Security
- **Automated Threat Detection:** Machine learning algorithms for real-time anomaly detection
- **Predictive Security:** AI models predicting and preventing security incidents
- **Adaptive Response:** Automated security responses based on threat intelligence
- **Bias Mitigation:** Regular audits of AI security models for fairness and accuracy

### Quantum-Safe Cryptography
- **Post-Quantum Algorithms:** Implementation of quantum-resistant encryption standards
- **Key Management:** Secure key generation, distribution, and rotation protocols
- **Transition Planning:** Phased migration from current to quantum-safe cryptography
- **Algorithm Agility:** Framework for rapid algorithm updates as standards evolve

## Network Security Controls

### Access Control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Required for all administrative access
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions based on job responsibilities
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Context-aware access decisions
- **Privileged Access Management:** Special controls for elevated permissions

### Data Protection
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Data Classification:** Sensitive data identified and protected accordingly
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Automated prevention of unauthorized data exfiltration
- **Backup and Recovery:** Secure, encrypted backups with regular testing

### Infrastructure Security
- **Secure Boot:** Hardware and software verified at startup
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolation of critical network components
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Real-time monitoring and automated response
- **Physical Security:** Protection of network equipment and facilities

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

### National Security Compliance
- **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** Alignment with national cybersecurity frameworks
- **Supply Chain Security:** Verification of vendor and component security
- **Export Control Compliance:** Adherence to technology export regulations

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization:** Collection of only necessary user data
- **User Consent:** Transparent consent mechanisms for data usage
- **Privacy by Design:** Security integrated into system architecture
- **Breach Notification:** 72-hour notification requirement for security incidents

## Incident Response and Management

### Incident Classification
- **Critical:** Immediate threat to network availability or data integrity
- **High:** Significant security breach with potential user impact
- **Medium:** Security incident with limited scope
- **Low:** Minor security event with no user impact

### Response Procedures
- **Detection and Analysis:** Automated alerting and initial triage within 15 minutes
- **Containment:** Isolation of affected systems within 1 hour for critical incidents
- **Eradication:** Removal of threat vectors within 24 hours
- **Recovery:** System restoration and validation within 72 hours
- **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident review and process improvement

### Communication Protocols
- **Internal Notification:** Immediate notification to security team and executives
- **External Communication:** Coordinated disclosure to affected parties and regulators
- **Public Relations:** Managed communication to maintain stakeholder confidence

## Risk Management

### Threat Assessment
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time threat intelligence integration
