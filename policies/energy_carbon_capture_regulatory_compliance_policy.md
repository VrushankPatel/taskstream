# Energy Carbon Capture Regulatory Compliance Policy

## Policy Statement
This policy establishes requirements for carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations to ensure environmental protection, regulatory compliance, and operational safety across all company facilities.

## Applicability
Applies to all carbon capture facilities, transportation infrastructure, and storage sites operated by or contracted to the company.

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal Requirements
- EPA Clean Air Act compliance for emissions
- DOE carbon capture certification standards
- OSHA safety regulations for high-pressure systems
- DOT pipeline safety regulations

### State and Local Requirements
- State-specific emission reduction mandates
- Local zoning and permitting requirements
- Water quality protection regulations
- Community notification and engagement requirements

### International Standards
- ISO 27914:2017 Carbon dioxide capture, transportation, and geological storage
- IPCC guidelines for carbon accounting
- IEA best practices for CCS operations

## Environmental Protection Standards

### Emission Control
- Capture efficiency: Minimum 90% CO2 removal rate
- Fugitive emissions: <0.1% of captured volume annually
- Monitoring frequency: Continuous emission monitoring systems
- Reporting: Monthly emission reports to regulatory agencies

### Water Management
- Water usage: Minimize freshwater consumption through recycling
- Wastewater treatment: Zero liquid discharge for process water
- Groundwater monitoring: Quarterly sampling at all storage sites
- Spill prevention: Secondary containment systems for all tanks

### Air Quality
- VOC emissions: <10 tons per year per facility
- NOx emissions: <25 tons per year per facility
- Particulate matter: <5 tons per year per facility
- Odor control: Negative pressure systems and carbon filtration

## Safety and Operational Standards

### Facility Design
- Pressure vessel design: ASME Section VIII standards
- Pipeline specifications: API 5L grade requirements
- Storage site selection: Geologic stability assessment
- Emergency shutdown systems: Automatic activation within 30 seconds

### Operational Procedures
- Standard operating procedures for all CCS processes
- Emergency response plans for leaks and releases
- Maintenance schedules for all critical equipment
- Operator training and certification requirements

### Monitoring and Control
- Real-time process monitoring systems
- Automated control systems with manual override
- Alarm management systems for abnormal conditions
- Data logging and retention for 7 years minimum

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Performance Monitoring
- Capture rate monitoring: Hourly measurements
- Injection rate monitoring: Real-time tracking
- Pressure and temperature monitoring: Continuous sensors
- Seismic activity monitoring: 24/7 surveillance

### Environmental Monitoring
- Soil gas sampling: Quarterly at injection sites
- Groundwater quality: Semi-annual comprehensive testing
- Air quality monitoring: Continuous at facility perimeter
- Wildlife impact assessment: Annual comprehensive surveys

### Regulatory Reporting
- Monthly operational reports to EPA
- Annual compliance certifications
- Incident reporting within 24 hours
- Public disclosure of key performance metrics

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Wellbore integrity failure
- Seismic activity induced by injection
- CO2 leakage through faults or fractures
- Corrosion of infrastructure

### Operational Risks
- Equipment failure and downtime
