# Government Cybersecurity Framework Policy

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive cybersecurity standards and practices for all government digital systems and services to protect national infrastructure, citizen data, and maintain public trust.

## Scope
Applies to all government agencies, departments, and contractors handling sensitive data or critical infrastructure systems.

## Key Principles

### 1. Risk-Based Security Approach
- Implement security controls proportional to data sensitivity and system criticality
- Regular risk assessments conducted quarterly for all systems
- Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence integration

### 2. Defense in Depth Strategy
- Multiple layers of security controls across network, application, and data levels
- Zero trust architecture implementation for all sensitive systems
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

### 3. Data Protection and Privacy
- Encryption of all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Strict access controls with role-based permissions
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring

## Security Control Requirements

### Technical Controls
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, secure VPN access
- **Endpoint Protection**: Antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR), device management
- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices, web application firewalls, API security
- **Data Security**: Encryption standards, data loss prevention, backup and recovery

### Administrative Controls
- **Access Management**: Multi-factor authentication, least privilege principle, regular access reviews
- **Incident Response**: 24/7 security operations center, documented response procedures
- **Training and Awareness**: Mandatory cybersecurity training for all personnel annually
- **Vendor Management**: Security requirements for all third-party providers

### Physical Controls
- **Facility Security**: Secure data centers, access controls, environmental monitoring
- **Device Security**: Secure storage and disposal of hardware, clean desk policies

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (Months 1-3)
- Comprehensive security assessment of all systems
- Gap analysis against framework requirements
- Prioritized implementation roadmap development

### Phase 2: Core Security Implementation (Months 4-12)
- Deployment of fundamental security controls
- Staff training and awareness programs
- Security policy documentation and communication

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Measures (Months 13-24)
- Implementation of advanced threat detection
- Security orchestration and automation
- Continuous improvement processes

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Monitoring and Auditing
- Monthly security control effectiveness reviews
- Annual independent security audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring with automated reporting

### Incident Reporting Requirements
- Security incidents reported within 1 hour of detection
- Root cause analysis completed within 72 hours
- Lessons learned incorporated into framework updates

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
- Corrective action plans required for deficiencies
- Escalation to senior leadership for repeated violations
- Potential contract termination for critical security failures

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- Overall cybersecurity program leadership
- Framework development and maintenance
- Executive reporting and risk communication

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- 24/7 monitoring and incident response
- Threat intelligence analysis and dissemination
- Security control maintenance and updates

### Agency Security Officers
- Implementation of framework within their organizations
- Local security policy development
- Staff training coordination

### Employees and Contractors
- Compliance with security policies and procedures
- Reporting of security incidents and suspicious activities
- Participation in required training programs

## Performance Metrics
- **Security Incident Rate**: Target <5 incidents per year
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Target <24 hours
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Target <4 hours
- **Security Training Completion**: Target 100%
- **Audit Compliance Score**: Target >95%

## Review and Updates
- Framework reviewed annually or following significant security incidents
- Updates based on emerging threats, technology changes, and lessons learned
- Stakeholder input incorporated through working groups and public consultations
