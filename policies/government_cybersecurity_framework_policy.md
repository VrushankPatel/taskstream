# Government Cybersecurity Framework Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive cybersecurity standards and procedures for all government digital systems and services, ensuring protection of citizen data, critical infrastructure, and national security interests through a risk-based, defense-in-depth approach.

## Scope
Applies to all government agencies, departments, and contractors handling sensitive data or operating critical infrastructure systems. Covers cloud services, on-premises systems, mobile applications, and IoT devices.

## Core Principles

### Risk-Based Security
- **Proportional Controls**: Security measures commensurate with data sensitivity and system criticality
- **Continuous Risk Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation of threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to prevent, detect, and respond to incidents
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify approach to network access and data flows

### Citizen Protection and Privacy
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and retain only necessary personal information
- **Privacy by Design**: Integrate privacy protections into system development lifecycle
- **Transparent Practices**: Clear communication about data collection and protection practices
- **Individual Rights**: Respect for citizen privacy rights and data subject access requests

### Operational Resilience
- **Business Continuity**: Ensure critical services remain available during cyber incidents
- **Incident Response**: Rapid detection, containment, and recovery capabilities
- **Supply Chain Security**: Secure vendor and third-party relationships
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular assessment and enhancement of security posture

## Security Control Framework

### Identity and Access Management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all privileged and remote access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Least privilege access based on job responsibilities
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review and certification of user access rights
- **Account Lifecycle Management**: Automated provisioning and deprovisioning processes

### Network and Infrastructure Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Logical separation of sensitive systems and data
- **Encryption Standards**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Secure Configuration**: Hardened system configurations with automated compliance monitoring
- **Boundary Protection**: Next-generation firewalls and intrusion prevention systems

### Data Protection and Privacy
- **Data Classification**: Four-tier classification system (Public, Internal, Sensitive, Restricted)
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Automated monitoring and blocking of sensitive data exfiltration
- **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Required for all new systems and major changes
- **Retention Policies**: Automated deletion of data beyond required retention periods

### Application Security
- **Secure Development**: Mandatory secure coding practices and code reviews
- **Vulnerability Management**: Weekly scanning and monthly penetration testing
- **API Security**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for API authentication
- **Third-Party Software**: Approved software inventory with security validation

## Incident Response and Management

### Incident Classification
- **Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low based on impact and scope
- **Response Times**: 15 minutes for critical incidents, 4 hours for high incidents
- **Escalation Procedures**: Automatic escalation based on incident severity
- **Communication Protocols**: Coordinated communication with stakeholders and public

### Recovery and Continuity
- **Backup and Recovery**: Daily backups with 1-hour RPO and 4-hour RTO for critical systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Annual testing of recovery procedures
- **Business Continuity Plans**: Agency-specific plans with cross-agency coordination
- **Crisis Management**: Integration with national emergency response frameworks

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Compliance
- **National Cybersecurity Standards**: Alignment with government cybersecurity frameworks
- **International Standards**: Compliance with NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR equivalents
- **Industry-Specific Requirements**: Additional controls for critical infrastructure sectors
- **Audit Requirements**: Annual independent security audits and penetration testing

### Governance Structure
- **Cybersecurity Council**: Executive-level oversight and strategic direction
- **Chief Information Security Officers**: Agency-level security leadership
- **Central Cybersecurity Authority**: National coordination and standards development
- **Public-Private Partnerships**: Collaboration with industry for threat intelligence sharing

### Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Annual comprehensive risk assessments for all systems
- **Vulnerability Management**: Continuous monitoring and patching within defined timeframes
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration of national and international threat feeds
- **Insurance Coverage**: Cyber liability insurance for high-risk systems

## Implementation and Training

### Staff Training Requirements
- **Security Awareness Training**: Annual training for all personnel
- **Role-Specific Training**: Specialized training for IT, security, and development staff
- **Incident Response Drills**: Quarterly simulation exercises
- **Certification Programs**: Industry-recognized certifications for security professionals

### Technology Standards
- **Approved Technologies**: Government-approved security tools and platforms
- **Cloud Security**: FedRAMP-compliant cloud service providers
- **Endpoint Protection**: Mandatory endpoint detection and response solutions
- **Security Information and Event Management**: Centralized logging and monitoring

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Performance Metrics
- **Security Metrics**: Incident response times, vulnerability remediation rates
- **Compliance Metrics**: Audit findings, control implementation status
- **Threat Metrics**: Detected threats, blocked attacks, successful breaches
- **Training Metrics**: Training completion rates, awareness assessment scores

### Reporting Requirements
- **Monthly Reports**: Security posture and incident summaries
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Risk assessment updates and control effectiveness
- **Annual Reports**: Comprehensive security assessment and strategic planning
- **Incident Reports**: Immediate reporting of security breaches and significant incidents

## Enforcement and Accountability
- **Policy Violations**: Progressive discipline including termination for serious violations
- **Non-Compliance Penalties**: Financial penalties and service restrictions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated compliance monitoring with alerts
- **Improvement Plans**: Corrective action plans for identified deficiencies
