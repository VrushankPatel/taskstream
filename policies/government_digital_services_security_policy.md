# Government Digital Services Security Policy

## Policy Overview
This policy establishes security requirements for all government digital services, ensuring the protection of citizen data, system integrity, and national cybersecurity standards.

## Scope
Applies to all digital services, platforms, and systems operated by government agencies, including citizen-facing applications, internal systems, and cloud infrastructure.

## Core Principles

### Citizen-Centric Security
- Security measures designed to protect citizen privacy and data rights
- Transparent security practices with public accountability
- Minimal data collection with maximum protection
- Accessibility maintained alongside security requirements

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify approach to all access requests
- Micro-segmentation of networks and applications
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Least privilege access principles

### Resilience and Continuity
- Business continuity planning integrated with security
- Disaster recovery capabilities for all critical services
- Regular testing of security incident response
- Redundant systems for high-availability services

## Security Requirements

### Identity and Access Management
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Required for all user accounts and administrative access
   - Biometric options for citizen services
   - Risk-based authentication for suspicious activities
   - Integration with national identity systems

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Granular permissions based on job functions
   - Regular access reviews and certifications
   - Automated provisioning and deprovisioning
   - Audit trails for all access changes

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption Standards**
   - End-to-end encryption for data in transit
   - AES-256 encryption for data at rest
   - Key management systems with rotation policies
   - Homomorphic encryption for sensitive computations

2. **Data Classification and Handling**
   - Four-tier classification system (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
   - Automated classification tools
   - Data retention schedules by classification
   - Secure data disposal procedures

### Network and Infrastructure Security
1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Zero-trust network architecture
   - Micro-segmentation for application isolation
   - Secure remote access solutions
   - Continuous network monitoring

2. **Cloud Security**
   - FedRAMP certified cloud providers only
   - Shared responsibility model implementation
   - Container security and orchestration
   - Multi-cloud security management

### Application Security
1. **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
   - Security requirements in design phase
   - Automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines
   - Regular security code reviews
   - Vulnerability management programs

2. **API Security**
   - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
   - API rate limiting and throttling
   - Comprehensive API logging and monitoring
   - Version management and deprecation policies

## Incident Response and Management

### Incident Response Framework
1. **Detection and Analysis**
   - 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring
   - Automated threat detection systems
   - Incident classification and prioritization
   - Forensic analysis capabilities

2. **Response and Recovery**
   - Pre-defined incident response playbooks
   - Cross-agency coordination protocols
   - Communication plans for stakeholders
   - System recovery and restoration procedures

3. **Post-Incident Activities**
   - Root cause analysis and lessons learned
   - Incident reporting to oversight bodies
   - System and process improvements
   - Regulatory notification requirements

### Breach Notification
- 72-hour notification requirement for breaches
- Citizen notification within 24 hours for personal data breaches
- Coordination with national cybersecurity agency
- Public communication protocols

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- Alignment with national cybersecurity framework
- GDPR and privacy regulation compliance
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Industry-specific regulatory requirements

### Security Auditing
- Annual third-party security audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- Configuration and change management audits
