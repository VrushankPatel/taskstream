### Environmental Sustainability
- Preference for green hydrogen production using renewable energy
- Carbon capture and utilization required for blue hydrogen facilities
- Lifecycle emissions monitoring and reporting
- Biodiversity impact assessments for new infrastructure

### Technological Innovation
- Investment in R&D for efficiency improvements and cost reduction
- Collaboration with technology partners and research institutions
- Pilot programs to test emerging technologies
- Knowledge sharing across industry stakeholders

### Economic Viability
- Cost-benefit analysis for all major investments
- Competitive positioning in emerging hydrogen markets
- Diversification of revenue streams
- Long-term planning for market evolution
