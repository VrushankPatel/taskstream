# Insurance Cyber Risk Management Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for insurance operations to protect sensitive customer data, ensure business continuity, and maintain regulatory compliance in an evolving threat landscape.

## Scope
Applies to all insurance company employees, contractors, systems, and third-party vendors handling customer data or critical business systems.

## Core Principles

### **Security First Approach**
- Cybersecurity is integral to all business operations
- Risk assessment precedes any system implementation
- Defense-in-depth strategy with multiple security layers
- Zero-trust model for network access

### **Data Protection Priority**
- Customer data is the company's most valuable asset
- Privacy by design in all systems and processes
- Minimal data collection and retention policies
- Secure data handling throughout lifecycle

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and state insurance regulations
- Regular security assessments and audits
- Incident reporting requirements
- Breach notification procedures

### **Business Continuity**
- Cybersecurity incidents do not disrupt core insurance operations
- Redundant systems and backup procedures
- Regular testing of incident response plans
- Insurance coverage for cyber risks

## Technical Security Requirements

### **Access Control**
- Multi-factor authentication for all systems
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege principle
- Regular access review and revocation

### **Network Security**
- Next-generation firewall implementation
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Secure remote access (VPN, zero-trust network access)
- Network segmentation for sensitive data

### **Endpoint Protection**
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) on all devices
- Regular security patching and updates
- Device encryption requirements
- Mobile device management (MDM)

### **Data Security**
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Database activity monitoring
- Data loss prevention (DLP) controls
- Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Operational Security

### **Incident Response**
- 24/7 security operations center (SOC)
- Incident response team with defined roles
- Escalation procedures for different threat levels
- Post-incident analysis and improvement

### **Security Awareness**
- Mandatory annual security training for all employees
- Phishing simulation exercises quarterly
- Security champions program
- Regular security communications

### **Vendor Management**
- Third-party risk assessments for all vendors
- Security requirements in vendor contracts
- Regular vendor security audits
- Incident notification requirements

### **Physical Security**
- Secure server room access controls
- Visitor management procedures
- Clean desk policy
- Secure document disposal

## Risk Management

### **Risk Assessment**
- Annual comprehensive risk assessment
- Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Threat intelligence monitoring
- Emerging threat evaluation

### **Insurance Coverage**
- Cyber liability insurance with adequate coverage
- Business interruption coverage
- Data breach response coverage
- Professional liability for security incidents

## Monitoring and Compliance

### **Security Metrics**
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) threats: < 24 hours
- Mean time to respond (MTTR): < 4 hours
- Security incident rate: < 0.5 per month
- Compliance audit pass rate: 100%

### **Reporting Requirements**
- Monthly security dashboard to executive team
- Quarterly board reporting on cybersecurity posture
- Annual regulatory compliance certification
- Incident reports to regulators as required

## Enforcement
- Security policy violations treated as serious offenses
- Progressive discipline: Warning, suspension, termination

- Legal action for willful security breaches

## Training and Awareness
- New employee security orientation
- Role-specific security training
- Annual security awareness refreshers
- Executive cybersecurity education

## Review and Updates
- Annual policy review and updates
- Updates triggered by new threats or regulations
- Employee feedback incorporation
- Continuous improvement based on industry best practices
