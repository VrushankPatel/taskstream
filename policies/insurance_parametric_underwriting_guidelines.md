# Insurance Parametric Underwriting Guidelines

## Overview
**Policy Name:** Parametric Underwriting Framework
**Department:** Underwriting
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** March 15, 2025
**Approval Authority:** Chief Risk Officer

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for underwriting parametric insurance products, ensuring consistent risk assessment, pricing adequacy, and regulatory compliance while maintaining profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Scope
Applies to all parametric insurance products including weather, cyber, earthquake, and emerging risk covers across all distribution channels and geographies.

## Key Principles

### 1. Risk Assessment Standards
- **Data Quality Requirements**: All parametric triggers must use verified, real-time data sources with >95% accuracy
- **Correlation Analysis**: Minimum 10-year historical data required for trigger development
- **Stress Testing**: All models must pass 99.9th percentile extreme event scenarios
- **Independent Validation**: Third-party actuarial review required for all new parametric products

### 2. Pricing Framework
- **Risk-Adjusted Pricing**: Premiums must reflect true risk probability and severity
- **Profit Margin Requirements**: Minimum 15% underwriting profit margin for all products
- **Reinsurance Structure**: Minimum 30% risk transfer to reinsurers for high-severity events
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Annual review and adjustment based on claims experience and market conditions

### 3. Underwriting Limits
- **Single Risk Limit**: Maximum €50M per parametric trigger
- **Aggregate Limit**: Maximum €200M portfolio exposure per peril type
- **Concentration Limits**: No more than 15% of portfolio in single geographic region
- **Counterparty Limits**: Maximum 10% exposure to any single data provider

### 4. Product Design Standards
- **Trigger Transparency**: All parametric triggers must be clearly defined and verifiable
- **Payout Speed**: Maximum 24-hour payout commitment for valid claims
- **Basis Risk Management**: Maximum 5% basis risk tolerance
- **Customer Education**: Mandatory disclosure of parametric mechanics and limitations

## Underwriting Process

### Application Review
1. **Data Source Verification**: Confirm reliability and timeliness of trigger data
2. **Risk Modeling**: Apply approved parametric models to assess probability and severity
3. **Pricing Calculation**: Determine premium based on risk-adjusted framework
4. **Compliance Check**: Ensure regulatory requirements are met

### Approval Workflow
- **Underwriter Authority**: Up to €1M single risk, €5M aggregate
- **Manager Approval**: €1M-€5M single risk, €5M-€20M aggregate
- **Committee Review**: >€5M single risk, >€20M aggregate, new product types
- **Board Approval**: >€10M single risk, strategic product decisions

### Documentation Requirements
- **Underwriting Memorandum**: Detailed risk assessment and pricing justification
- **Model Validation Report**: Independent review of parametric triggers
- **Regulatory Filing**: Complete documentation for insurance regulators
- **Customer Disclosure**: Clear explanation of coverage terms and limitations

## Risk Management

### Model Risk Controls
- **Regular Validation**: Quarterly model performance review
- **Backtesting Requirements**: Minimum 5-year historical validation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Annual stress testing of all models
- **Expert Judgment**: Override protocols for model limitations

### Operational Risk Controls
- **Data Provider Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of data source reliability
