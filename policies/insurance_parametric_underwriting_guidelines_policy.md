# Insurance Parametric Underwriting Guidelines Policy

## Policy Overview
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** September 1, 2025
**Scope:** All parametric insurance products and underwriting activities
**Objective:** Establish standardized underwriting practices for parametric insurance to ensure product integrity, regulatory compliance, and risk management

## Purpose
This policy provides comprehensive guidelines for underwriting parametric insurance products, ensuring consistent risk assessment, pricing, and product design across all parametric offerings. It addresses the unique characteristics of parametric insurance while maintaining alignment with traditional underwriting principles.

## Core Principles

### Risk-Based Underwriting
- Base coverage on objective, measurable parameters
- Ensure parameter correlation with actual loss potential
- Maintain basis risk within acceptable limits (<5%)
- Use historical data and catastrophe modeling for pricing

### Transparency and Fairness
- Clearly disclose parametric triggers and payout structures
- Ensure products are understandable to policyholders
- Provide fair and non-discriminatory access
- Maintain competitive pricing aligned with risk

### Regulatory Compliance
- Adhere to state insurance department requirements
- Comply with NAIC parametric insurance guidelines
- Meet solvency and capital requirements
- Ensure proper licensing and approval processes

## Underwriting Process

### Product Design Phase
1. **Parameter Selection**: Choose objective, verifiable parameters (e.g., wind speed, earthquake magnitude, cyber incident frequency)
2. **Trigger Development**: Define clear payout triggers with scientific or industry standard thresholds
3. **Payout Structure**: Design payout scales that correlate with loss severity
4. **Basis Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and document potential basis risk factors

### Risk Assessment Phase
1. **Data Analysis**: Review historical parameter data and loss correlations
2. **Catastrophe Modeling**: Use approved models for scenario analysis
3. **Geographic Considerations**: Assess regional risk factors and data availability
4. **Portfolio Impact**: Evaluate aggregate risk across the parametric portfolio

### Pricing and Terms Phase
1. **Premium Calculation**: Base on expected loss costs plus expenses and profit margin
2. **Deductible Structure**: Consider appropriate attachment points and exhaustion levels
3. **Policy Limits**: Set reasonable maximum payouts based on risk analysis
4. **Term Length**: Align coverage periods with risk seasons or policy needs

## Product Categories

## Underwriting Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **Data Quality**: Use verified, high-quality parameter data sources
- **Model Validation**: Annual independent validation of pricing models
- **Documentation**: Complete underwriting file for each product
- **Peer Review**: Senior underwriter review for complex or high-limit products

### Risk Limits
- **Single Risk**: Maximum $50M per location or event
- **Portfolio Concentration**: No more than 10% in single peril type
- **Geographic Diversification**: Minimum 20 countries/regions for global products
- **Reinsurance**: 50% minimum reinsurance coverage for catastrophe risks

### Quality Assurance
- **File Reviews**: 100% of parametric underwriting files reviewed quarterly
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track payout accuracy and customer satisfaction
- **Model Updates**: Quarterly review and update of pricing models
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of underwriting decisions

## Compliance and Controls

### Regulatory Requirements
- **State Filings**: File all parametric products with appropriate state departments
- **Rate Filings**: Submit pricing models and assumptions for approval
- **Consumer Protection**: Ensure clear disclosure of parametric mechanics
