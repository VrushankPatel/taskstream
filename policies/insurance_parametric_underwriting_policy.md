# Insurance Parametric Underwriting Policy

## Policy Overview
**Effective Date:** April 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** July 5, 2025
**Scope:** All parametric insurance products and underwriting activities
**Objective:** Ensure responsible development and pricing of parametric insurance products

## Purpose
This policy establishes the standards for parametric insurance product development, risk assessment, pricing, and claims handling. It ensures products are based on objective, measurable parameters while maintaining financial stability and customer protection.

## Parametric Insurance Principles

### Core Characteristics
- **Objectivity**: Payouts based on verifiable parameters, not loss assessment
- **Speed**: Rapid claims settlement without damage verification
- **Transparency**: Clear trigger definitions and payout structures
- **Scalability**: Ability to cover large numbers of similar risks
- **Affordability**: Lower premiums due to reduced claims handling costs

### Product Types
- **Weather Parametric**: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed triggers
- **Earthquake Parametric**: Ground motion and intensity measurements
- **Cyber Parametric**: Attack frequency, duration, or impact metrics
- **Pandemic Parametric**: Infection rates, mortality data, economic indicators

## Risk Assessment Standards

### Parameter Selection
- Scientifically valid and measurable parameters
- Historical data availability (minimum 20 years)
- Correlation with insured losses (>70% correlation coefficient)
- Independence from human manipulation

### Model Validation
- Back-testing against historical events
- Stress testing under extreme scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis for parameter changes
- Independent peer review and validation

### Basis Risk Management
- Clear disclosure of basis risk to customers
- Conservative parameter settings to protect policyholders
- Reinsurance structures to manage aggregate risk
- Regular model updates and recalibration
