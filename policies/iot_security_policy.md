# IoT Device and Network Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, networks, and applications to protect organizational assets, customer data, and operational integrity.

## Scope
Applies to all IoT devices, sensors, gateways, and related infrastructure deployed in organizational facilities, products, or services, including third-party managed devices.

## Core Security Principles

### Device Security
- All IoT devices must have unique identifiers and secure boot capabilities
- Default passwords must be changed before deployment
- Firmware updates must be automated and verified
- End-of-life devices must be securely decommissioned

### Network Security
- IoT devices must be segmented from corporate networks
- Encrypted communications required for all data transmission
- Network access controls implemented using zero-trust principles
- Regular network scanning and vulnerability assessments

### Data Protection
- Data minimization principles applied to IoT data collection
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Data retention policies enforced with automatic deletion
- Privacy-by-design incorporated into IoT solutions

## Device Lifecycle Management

### Procurement and Onboarding
1. Security requirements defined in procurement specifications
2. Vendor security assessments conducted before purchase
3. Device certificates validated before network connection
4. Inventory management system updated with device details

### Deployment and Configuration
1. Secure configuration baselines established
2. Network segmentation implemented
3. Access controls configured appropriately
4. Monitoring and logging enabled

### Maintenance and Updates
1. Automated patch management implemented
2. Firmware updates tested before deployment
3. Backup and recovery procedures documented
4. Performance monitoring established

### Decommissioning
1. Data securely wiped from devices
2. Network access revoked
3. Inventory records updated
4. Physical destruction for high-risk devices

## Network Architecture

### Segmentation Strategy
- IoT devices isolated in separate VLANs/subnets
- Guest networks for temporary IoT access
- Air-gapping for critical industrial IoT systems
- Micro-segmentation for high-security environments

### Access Control
- Device authentication using certificates or secure tokens
- Role-based access control for device management
- Least privilege principle applied
- Regular access reviews conducted

### Monitoring and Detection
- Continuous network traffic monitoring
- Anomaly detection systems deployed
- Security information and event management (SIEM) integration
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities

## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment
- Regular risk assessments for IoT deployments
- Threat modeling conducted for new IoT solutions
- Impact analysis for potential security incidents
- Mitigation strategies documented and implemented

### Incident Response
- IoT-specific incident response procedures
- Isolation capabilities for compromised devices
- Forensic analysis procedures defined
- Communication protocols for stakeholders

### Business Continuity
- Redundant systems for critical IoT functions
- Backup power and connectivity for IoT devices
- Disaster recovery plans including IoT restoration
- Alternative manual processes documented

## Compliance and Legal

### Regulatory Compliance
- Industry-specific regulations followed (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare IoT)
- Data protection laws adhered to (GDPR, CCPA)
- Critical infrastructure protection standards met
- Export control regulations considered

### Privacy Considerations
- Privacy impact assessments conducted
- User consent mechanisms implemented
- Data subject rights supported
- Transparency in data collection practices

## Third-Party Management

### Vendor Requirements
- Security questionnaires completed by all IoT vendors
- Service level agreements include security commitments
- Right to audit clauses included in contracts
- Incident notification requirements defined

### Supply Chain Security
- Hardware supply chain risks assessed
- Secure development practices verified for vendors
- Bill of materials security reviewed
- Counterfeit device detection procedures

## Training and Awareness

### Personnel Training
- IoT security awareness training for all employees
- Specialized training for IoT administrators
- Incident response training for security teams
- Regular refresher courses conducted

### User Education
- Safe IoT usage guidelines provided
- Password management best practices communicated
- Phishing awareness for IoT-related communications
- Reporting procedures for suspicious activities

## Monitoring and Enforcement

### Continuous Monitoring
- Automated security controls monitoring
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing conducted annually
- Compliance audits performed quarterly

### Policy Enforcement
- Automated enforcement through technical controls
- Manual oversight for critical decisions
- Non-compliance incidents documented and addressed
- Disciplinary procedures for policy violations

### Reporting and Metrics
- Security metrics reported monthly to leadership
- Incident trends analyzed quarterly
- Policy effectiveness reviewed annually
- Industry benchmarking conducted regularly

## Review and Updates
This policy will be reviewed annually and updated when:
- New IoT technologies are adopted
- Security threats evolve significantly
- Regulatory requirements change
- Lessons learned from incidents necessitate changes
