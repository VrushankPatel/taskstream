# Logistics Supply Chain Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements for protecting logistics operations, transportation assets, and supply chain integrity across all company facilities and transportation networks.

## Scope
Applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party logistics providers involved in transportation, warehousing, and supply chain operations.

## Security Principles

### Asset Protection
1. **Physical Security**: All transportation vehicles and warehouse facilities must maintain secure perimeters with controlled access
2. **Cargo Security**: High-value shipments require GPS tracking, tamper-evident seals, and real-time monitoring
3. **Facility Security**: Warehouses must implement 24/7 surveillance, access control systems, and emergency response protocols

### Personnel Security
1. **Background Checks**: All transportation personnel and warehouse staff undergo comprehensive background screening
2. **Training Requirements**: Annual security awareness training mandatory for all logistics personnel
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based access to sensitive areas and information systems

### Information Security
1. **Data Protection**: Shipment data, customer information, and routing details must be encrypted in transit and at rest
2. **Communication Security**: Use of secure channels for coordination between drivers, dispatchers, and customers
3. **Incident Reporting**: Mandatory reporting of security incidents within 1 hour of discovery

## Operational Security Measures

### Transportation Security
- **Route Planning**: High-risk routes require security escorts or alternative routing
- **Driver Protocols**: Standardized check-in procedures and emergency communication devices
- **Loading/Unloading**: Supervised processes with inventory verification at each stage

### Warehouse Security
- **Inventory Controls**: Regular cycle counts and reconciliation procedures
- **Visitor Management**: All visitors must be escorted and logged
- **Emergency Procedures**: Evacuation plans and coordination with local authorities

### Supply Chain Visibility
- **Vendor Assessment**: Third-party providers must demonstrate equivalent security standards
- **Audit Requirements**: Annual security audits of all logistics partners
- **Performance Monitoring**: Key security metrics tracked and reported quarterly

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Protocol
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate affected areas and secure assets
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of security incident
3. **Notification**: Alert appropriate authorities and stakeholders within required timeframes
4. **Investigation**: Conduct thorough investigation with documentation
5. **Recovery**: Restore operations with enhanced security measures
6. **Lessons Learned**: Review incident and update procedures
