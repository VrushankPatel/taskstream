# Manufacturing Circular Economy Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for implementing circular economy principles in manufacturing operations, promoting resource efficiency, waste reduction, and sustainable product lifecycle management to minimize environmental impact and create long-term business value.

## Scope
This policy applies to all manufacturing facilities, product design processes, supply chain operations, and product lifecycle management activities across the organization.

## Definitions
- **Circular Economy**: An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources through reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling
- **Product Lifecycle**: All stages from raw material extraction through design, production, use, and end-of-life management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Maximizing the productive use of resources while minimizing waste and environmental impact
- **Design for Circularity**: Product design principles that enable repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling

## Circular Economy Principles

### 1. Design for Circularity
- Products designed for durability, repairability, and upgradeability
- Use of modular components and standardized interfaces
- Selection of recyclable and bio-based materials
- Minimization of material variety and toxic substances

### 2. Resource Efficiency
- Maximization of resource utilization throughout the product lifecycle
- Implementation of closed-loop material flows
- Energy efficiency in production processes
- Water conservation and waste minimization

### 3. Extended Product Life
- Product longevity through design and quality
- Repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing capabilities
- Component reuse and material recovery programs
- Consumer education on product care and maintenance

### 4. Waste Prevention
- Zero-waste manufacturing processes
- By-product utilization and industrial symbiosis
- Packaging reduction and optimization
- End-of-life product collection and processing

### 5. Regeneration of Natural Systems
- Use of renewable energy sources
- Restoration of ecosystems affected by operations
- Biodiversity protection in supply chains
- Carbon sequestration and emission reduction
