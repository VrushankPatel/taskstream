## Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for comprehensive supply chain traceability to ensure product quality, regulatory compliance, and rapid response to quality issues across the manufacturing supply chain.

## Scope
This policy applies to all suppliers, subcontractors, and internal manufacturing operations involved in the production of finished goods.

## Key Requirements

### Traceability Standards
1. **Product Traceability**: All raw materials, components, and finished products must be traceable from supplier to customer delivery
2. **Batch/Lot Tracking**: Complete batch and lot number tracking throughout the manufacturing process
3. **Digital Record Keeping**: All traceability data must be maintained in digital format for minimum 7 years

### Data Collection Requirements
1. **Supplier Data**: Suppliers must provide complete traceability data including:
   - Raw material sources and origins
   - Manufacturing processes and quality controls
   - Batch/lot numbers and production dates
   - Quality test results and certificates

2. **Internal Tracking**: Manufacturing operations must track:
   - Material receipt and inspection records
   - Production batch assignments
   - Quality control checkpoints
   - Packaging and shipping documentation

### Technology Standards
1. **Digital Systems**: Implementation of RFID, barcode, or IoT tracking systems
2. **Data Integration**: Real-time integration with ERP and quality management systems
3. **Blockchain Implementation**: Use of blockchain technology for immutable traceability records where required
