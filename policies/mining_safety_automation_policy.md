# Mining Safety Automation Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for the implementation and management of automated safety systems in mining operations to enhance worker protection and operational efficiency.

## Scope
Applies to all mining operations, including surface and underground mines, processing facilities, and transportation systems. Covers autonomous equipment, monitoring systems, and safety automation technologies.

## Safety Automation Requirements

### System Design Standards
- All automated systems must meet or exceed industry safety standards (ISO 17757, MSHA regulations)  
- Redundant safety systems with fail-safe mechanisms  
- Human oversight capabilities for all autonomous operations  

### Risk Assessment Protocol
- Comprehensive hazard identification for automated systems  
- Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for all safety-critical components  
- Regular risk reassessment following system modifications  

### Human-Machine Interface
- Intuitive operator interfaces with clear status indicators  
- Emergency stop mechanisms accessible within 10 seconds  
- Override capabilities for human operators in all situations  

## Implementation Guidelines

### Deployment Phases
- Pilot testing in controlled environments before full deployment  
- Phased rollout with comprehensive training programs  
- Parallel operation with manual systems during transition period  

### Training Requirements
- Specialized training for operators of automated systems  
- Emergency response training for automation failures  
- Maintenance personnel certification for automated equipment  

### Maintenance Standards
- Predictive maintenance schedules based on manufacturer recommendations  
- Regular system health monitoring and diagnostics  
- Backup systems tested weekly with full documentation  

## Operational Controls

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time monitoring of all automated safety systems  
- Automated alerts for system anomalies or failures  
- Centralized control room oversight for critical operations  

### Emergency Procedures
- Automated emergency shutdown protocols  
- Manual override procedures for system failures  
- Evacuation protocols for automation-related incidents  

### Performance Tracking
- System uptime and reliability metrics  
- Incident rates compared to manual operations  
- Safety improvement measurements (TRIR reduction targets)  

## Data Management and Privacy

### Operational Data
- Secure storage of system performance and incident data  
- Data retention for 7 years for regulatory compliance  
- Access controls limiting data to authorized personnel  

### Worker Monitoring
- Minimal personal data collection from safety systems  
- Clear privacy notices for any worker monitoring features  
- Data used only for safety improvement purposes  

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- Regular audits against mining safety regulations  
- Documentation of all safety system certifications  
- Reporting requirements for automation-related incidents  

### Internal Controls
- Quarterly safety committee reviews of automation systems  
- Annual third-party safety audits  
- Continuous improvement based on incident analysis  

### Performance Metrics
- Automation system availability: Target >99.5%  
- Mean time between failures: Target >6 months  
- Safety incident reduction: Target >20% YoY  

## Vendor and Contractor Requirements

### Selection Criteria
- Proven safety record with automated mining systems  
- Comprehensive support and maintenance agreements  
- Compatibility with existing safety management systems  

### Contractual Obligations
- Performance guarantees for safety system effectiveness  
- Training and documentation delivery requirements  
- Liability provisions for system failures  

## Continuous Improvement

### Technology Evaluation
- Regular assessment of emerging safety technologies  
- Pilot programs for innovative automation solutions  
- Cost-benefit analysis for safety system upgrades  

### Lessons Learned
- Post-incident reviews of automation system performance  
- Incorporation of findings into system improvements  
- Sharing of best practices across mining operations  

### Training Updates
- Annual refresher training on automated safety systems  
- Updates following system modifications or incidents  
- Cross-training between manual and automated operations
