# Mining Safety Automation Protocols Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes safety protocols for automated systems and robotics in mining operations to ensure worker protection, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all automated mining equipment, robotic systems, and AI-assisted operations across surface and underground mines in all jurisdictions.

## Safety Principles

### Human-Centric Automation
- Automation systems must enhance, not replace, human judgment
- Human operators retain final decision authority
- Systems designed for human oversight and intervention
- Emergency stop capabilities accessible at all times

### Risk Assessment Requirements
- Comprehensive safety analysis for all automated systems
- Regular risk reassessments following incidents or modifications
- Third-party safety audits for critical systems
- Documentation of all safety controls and mitigations

### System Reliability Standards
- Redundant safety systems for critical functions
- Automated fault detection and isolation
- Graceful degradation during system failures
- Regular maintenance and testing protocols

## Automation Safety Protocols
