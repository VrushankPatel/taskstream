# API Management and Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for the design, implementation, management, and security of APIs within our organization. The goal is to ensure APIs are secure, reliable, scalable, and provide a consistent developer experience while protecting sensitive data and systems.

## Scope
This policy applies to all APIs developed, deployed, or consumed by the organization, including:
- Internal APIs for microservices communication
- External APIs for partner and third-party integration
- Mobile and web application APIs
- IoT device APIs
- Legacy system APIs

## Policy Principles

### 1. Security First
- All APIs must implement industry-standard security measures
- Authentication and authorization are mandatory for all API access
- Data in transit and at rest must be encrypted
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection must be implemented

### 2. Design Excellence
- APIs must follow RESTful principles or GraphQL best practices
- Consistent versioning strategy across all APIs
- Comprehensive documentation for all endpoints
- Backward compatibility maintained during updates

### 3. Operational Excellence
- APIs must be monitored for performance and availability
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines required
- Incident response procedures defined for API failures
- Capacity planning and scalability considerations

## API Development Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** Preferred for external APIs
- **API Keys:** Acceptable for low-risk internal APIs with additional controls
- **JWT Tokens:** Required for stateless authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Mandatory for administrative API access

### Security Controls
- **Input Validation:** All inputs validated against schemas
- **Output Encoding:** Prevent injection attacks through proper encoding
- **CORS Policy:** Strictly configured to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- **HTTPS Only:** All API communications must use TLS 1.3 or higher

### API Design Requirements
- **RESTful Standards:** Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- **Versioning:** URI versioning (e.g., /api/v1/resource) preferred
- **Pagination:** Required for list endpoints returning >100 items
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Standardized query parameters for data retrieval
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format with appropriate HTTP codes

## API Management Process

### API Lifecycle
1. **Planning:** Business requirements and technical specifications
2. **Design:** API contract definition and security review
3. **Development:** Implementation with automated testing
4. **Testing:** Security, performance, and integration testing
5. **Deployment:** Staged rollout with monitoring
6. **Maintenance:** Ongoing monitoring and version management
7. **Decommissioning:** Graceful retirement with stakeholder communication

### Governance
- **API Review Board:** Monthly reviews of new API designs
- **Security Assessments:** Required before production deployment
- **Performance Reviews:** Quarterly assessment of API metrics
- **Compliance Audits:** Annual reviews for regulatory requirements

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
- **Availability:** >99.9% uptime target
- **Performance:** P95 response time <500ms
- **Security:** Zero successful breach attempts
- **Usage:** Track API consumption patterns
- **Errors:** Monitor and alert on error rates >1%

### Logging Requirements
- **Access Logs:** All API requests logged with user context
- **Error Logs:** Detailed error information for troubleshooting
- **Security Events:** All authentication and authorization events
- **Audit Logs:** Changes to API configurations and policies

## Third-Party API Usage

### Approval Process
- **Risk Assessment:** Required for all third-party API integrations
- **Contract Review:** Legal and security clauses must be approved
- **Testing:** Integration testing required before production use
- **Monitoring:** Third-party APIs must be included in monitoring systems

### Security Requirements
- **Data Classification:** Understand data handling by third parties
- **Incident Response:** Defined procedures for third-party API issues
- **Backup Plans:** Alternative solutions for critical third-party dependencies

## Incident Response

### API Security Incidents
1. **Detection:** Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment:** Immediate evaluation of impact and scope
3. **Containment:** Temporary measures to prevent further damage
4. **Recovery:** Restore normal operations with minimal disruption
5. **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident review and policy updates

### Communication Protocol
- **Internal Teams:** Immediate notification to security and development teams
- **External Stakeholders:** As required by incident severity and legal obligations
- **Documentation:** Detailed incident reports for compliance and improvement

## Compliance & Legal

### Regulatory Requirements
- **GDPR/CCPA:** Data subject rights and privacy by design
- **SOX:** Financial data handling and audit trails
- **Industry Standards:** PCI DSS for payment APIs, HIPAA for health data

### Data Protection
- **PII Handling:** Special controls for personally identifiable information
- **Data Retention:** Defined retention periods for API logs and data
- **Cross-Border Transfers:** Compliance with data localization requirements

## Training & Awareness

### Required Training
- **API Developers:** Annual security and best practices training
- **API Consumers:** Basic security awareness for API usage
- **Administrators:** Advanced training for API management tools

### Documentation
- **Developer Portal:** Centralized documentation for all APIs
- **Security Guidelines:** Detailed guides for secure API development
- **Best Practices:** Regularly updated guides for API design and management

## Policy Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Automated Checks:** CI/CD pipelines enforce security standards
- **Regular Audits:** Quarterly reviews of API implementations
- **Penalties:** Non-compliance may result in API deprecation or access revocation

### Exceptions
- **Exception Process:** Documented process for policy exceptions
- **Risk Assessment:** Required for all exception requests
- **Time Limits:** Exceptions granted for maximum 6 months with review
