# Edge Computing Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements and controls for edge computing infrastructure to protect sensitive data, ensure system integrity, and maintain regulatory compliance across distributed computing environments.

## Scope
Applies to all edge computing nodes, gateways, and associated infrastructure deployed globally, including third-party managed edge locations.

## Security Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Identity Verification**: All access requires multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Least Privilege**: Access limited to minimum required permissions
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing validation of device and user trustworthiness

### 2. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data processing restricted to approved edge locations
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data stored at edge nodes

### 3. Network Security
- **Segmentation**: Edge networks isolated from corporate and cloud networks
- **Secure Communications**: TLS 1.3 required for all edge-to-cloud communications
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time monitoring and automated response systems

## Technical Controls

### Access Control
- **Device Authentication**: Certificate-based authentication for all edge devices
- **User Access**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with regular review
- **Remote Access**: VPN required for administrative access to edge infrastructure

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging of all security events
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered monitoring for unusual patterns
- **Audit Logging**: 12-month retention of security logs

### Incident Response
- **Automated Response**: Immediate isolation of compromised devices
- **Escalation Procedures**: 15-minute response time for critical incidents
- **Forensic Capabilities**: Secure logging for incident investigation

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR**: Data processing agreements for EU-deployed edge nodes
- **CCPA**: Opt-out handling for California user data
- **Industry Standards**: SOC 2 Type II compliance for edge operations

### Certification Requirements
- **Annual Audits**: Independent security assessments of edge infrastructure
- **Vulnerability Management**: Monthly scanning and quarterly penetration testing
- **Compliance Reporting**: Quarterly reports to regulatory bodies

## Operational Security

### Device Management
- **Secure Boot**: Hardware-based verification of device integrity
- **Patch Management**: Automated security updates within 24 hours
- **End-of-Life**: Secure decommissioning of retired edge devices

### Physical Security
- **Facility Access**: Controlled access to edge locations with surveillance
- **Tamper Detection**: Hardware and software tamper-evident controls
- **Supply Chain Security**: Vendor assessment for hardware components

### Personnel Security
- **Background Checks**: Required for all personnel with edge access
- **Security Training**: Annual training on edge security procedures
- **Insider Threat**: Monitoring for unauthorized data access attempts

## Risk Management

### Threat Assessment
- **Regular Risk Assessments**: Bi-annual evaluation of edge security threats
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous monitoring of known vulnerabilities
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration of global threat intelligence feeds

### Business Continuity
- **Disaster Recovery**: Redundant edge locations with automatic failover
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure storage and transmission
- **Recovery Testing**: Quarterly testing of security incident recovery procedures

## Policy Enforcement

### Responsibilities
- **Edge Security Team**: Implementation and monitoring of security controls
- **Business Units**: Compliance with security requirements for edge deployments
- **IT Security**: Oversight and audit of edge security posture

### Violations & Consequences
- **Minor Violations**: Warning and corrective action plan
- **Major Violations**: Suspension of access and formal investigation
- **Critical Violations**: Immediate termination and legal action

### Review & Updates
- **Annual Review**: Policy updated based on threat landscape changes
- **Change Management**: Version control and approval for policy modifications
- **Communication**: Annual training and distribution to all stakeholders
