# Serverless Computing Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements and best practices for the design, development, deployment, and operation of serverless computing environments within our organization. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of serverless applications while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Scope
This policy applies to all serverless functions, workflows, and related infrastructure deployed on cloud platforms including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and similar services.

## Security Principles

### 1. Least Privilege Access
- **Function Execution Roles:** Assign minimal IAM permissions required for function execution
- **Resource Policies:** Implement restrictive resource policies for API Gateway, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables
- **Runtime Permissions:** Use execution roles with granular permissions based on function purpose

### 2. Secure Development Practices
- **Code Review Requirements:** All serverless code must undergo security-focused code review
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly update and scan third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management:** Never store secrets in code; use secure parameter stores or key management services
- **Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all function inputs

### 3. Network Security
- **VPC Configuration:** Deploy functions within VPCs when accessing private resources
- **API Security:** Implement authentication and authorization for API Gateway endpoints
- **Traffic Encryption:** Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- **DDoS Protection:** Enable platform-level DDoS protection and monitoring

### 4. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases, caches, and storage services
- **Encryption in Transit:** Ensure all data transmission uses TLS 1.3 or higher
- **Data Classification:** Apply appropriate encryption based on data sensitivity levels
- **Data Retention:** Implement automated data lifecycle management and deletion policies

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Enable detailed logging for all function invocations and errors
- **Security Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring for anomalous activities
- **Alert Configuration:** Set up alerts for security events and compliance violations
- **Log Retention:** Maintain logs for minimum 7 years for compliance purposes

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR:** Implement data subject rights and privacy by design principles
- **HIPAA:** Apply additional controls for healthcare-related serverless applications
- **PCI DSS:** Follow payment card industry standards for financial functions
- **SOX:** Maintain audit trails for financial reporting functions

### Industry Standards
- **NIST Framework:** Align security controls with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **ISO 27001:** Implement information security management system controls
- **SOC 2:** Maintain trust principles for security, availability, and confidentiality

## Operational Security

### Deployment Security
- **CI/CD Security:** Implement secure deployment pipelines with automated security testing
- **Environment Separation:** Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production
- **Change Management:** Require approval for production deployments and configuration changes
- **Rollback Procedures:** Maintain ability to quickly rollback compromised or malfunctioning functions

### Incident Response
- **Detection and Analysis:** Implement automated threat detection and analysis capabilities
- **Containment Strategies:** Develop procedures to isolate compromised functions
- **Recovery Procedures:** Define steps for restoring service and data integrity
- **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct thorough reviews of security incidents with lessons learned

### Third-Party Risk Management
- **Vendor Assessment:** Evaluate cloud provider security controls and certifications
- **Contractual Obligations:** Include security requirements in vendor contracts
- **Supply Chain Security:** Monitor for vulnerabilities in serverless platform dependencies

## Access Control

### Identity and Access Management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Require MFA for all administrative access
- **Role-Based Access:** Implement role-based access control for development and operations teams
- **Temporary Access:** Use time-limited credentials for emergency access
- **Access Reviews:** Conduct quarterly access reviews and revoke unnecessary permissions

### Developer Access
- **Development Environments:** Provide secure development environments with necessary tools
- **Code Repository Security:** Implement branch protection and required reviews
- **Local Development:** Establish guidelines for secure local development practices

## Security Assessment and Auditing

### Regular Assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct automated vulnerability scanning of functions and dependencies
- **Penetration Testing:** Perform annual penetration testing of serverless applications
- **Configuration Reviews:** Regularly review and validate security configurations
- **Third-Party Audits:** Engage external auditors for compliance verification

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Security Metrics:** Track security KPIs and incident response metrics
- **Compliance Dashboards:** Maintain real-time compliance status visibility
- **Automated Remediation:** Implement automated remediation for common security issues
- **Reporting:** Generate monthly security reports for executive leadership

## Training and Awareness

### Security Training
- **Developer Training:** Provide annual security training for development teams
- **Security Awareness:** Conduct quarterly security awareness sessions
- **Platform-Specific Training:** Train teams on cloud platform security features
- **Incident Response Training:** Conduct annual incident response exercises

### Documentation and Communication
- **Security Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive security documentation
- **Change Communication:** Communicate security policy changes to affected teams
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide channels for reporting security concerns

## Policy Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Automated Enforcement:** Use policy-as-code to enforce security requirements
- **Exception Process:** Define process for approved security exceptions
- **Non-Compliance Consequences:** Establish consequences for policy violations
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and update policy based on emerging threats

### Policy Review
- **Annual Review:** Conduct annual policy review and updates
- **Change Management:** Document all policy changes with rationale
- **Stakeholder Input:** Solicit feedback from security team and business units
- **Version Control:** Maintain version history of policy documents
