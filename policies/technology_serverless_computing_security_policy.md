# Serverless Computing Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements and best practices for the design, development, deployment, and operation of serverless computing environments. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data while enabling secure serverless adoption across the organization.

## Scope
This policy applies to all serverless functions, event-driven architectures, and supporting infrastructure deployed on cloud platforms including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and equivalent services.

## Security Principles

### 1. Least Privilege Access
- **Function Permissions:** Serverless functions must be granted only the minimum permissions required for their specific tasks
- **IAM Roles:** Use granular IAM roles with principle of least privilege for function execution
- **Runtime Permissions:** Avoid broad permissions; use temporary, scoped credentials when possible

### 2. Secure Code Practices
- **Input Validation:** All function inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Secure Dependencies:** Use only vetted, up-to-date libraries with no known vulnerabilities
- **Code Reviews:** All serverless code must undergo security-focused code reviews before deployment
- **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets; use secure parameter stores or key management services

### 3. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive data stored by functions must be encrypted using platform-native encryption
- **Encryption in Transit:** Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all data transmission
- **Data Classification:** Classify data and apply appropriate protection levels based on sensitivity
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and process only necessary data for function operations

### 4. Network Security
- **VPC Integration:** Deploy functions within secure VPCs when accessing private resources
- **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict network access controls and security groups
- **API Gateway Security:** Use API Gateway features like throttling, authentication, and request validation
- **DDoS Protection:** Enable platform DDoS protection services for public-facing functions

## Authentication and Authorization

### Function Authentication
- **API Keys:** Use short-lived API keys for service-to-service authentication
- **OAuth/JWT:** Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for user-facing function authentication
- **Mutual TLS:** Require mutual TLS for high-security service communications
- **Zero Trust:** Assume no implicit trust; verify all requests explicitly

### Authorization Controls
- **Role-Based Access:** Implement role-based access control for function invocation
- **Attribute-Based Access:** Use attribute-based access control for fine-grained permissions
- **Policy Enforcement:** Enforce authorization policies at the function level
- **Audit Logging:** Log all authorization decisions for compliance and forensics

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring
- **Real-time Alerts:** Implement alerts for suspicious activities and security events
- **Anomaly Detection:** Use AI/ML for detecting anomalous function behavior
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor for performance degradation that may indicate attacks
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of security control effectiveness

### Logging Requirements
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all function invocations, errors, and security events
- **Structured Logs:** Use structured logging formats for easy analysis and correlation
- **Log Retention:** Retain logs for minimum 1 year or as required by compliance
- **Log Security:** Protect log data with encryption and access controls
- **Log Analysis:** Implement automated log analysis for threat detection

## Incident Response

### Incident Detection
- **Automated Detection:** Use monitoring tools to automatically detect security incidents
- **Manual Reporting:** Provide channels for reporting suspected security issues
- **Escalation Procedures:** Define clear escalation paths for different incident severities
- **Response Times:** Establish maximum response times based on incident criticality

### Incident Response Process
1. **Containment:** Immediately isolate affected functions and resources
2. **Investigation:** Conduct thorough forensic analysis of the incident
3. **Recovery:** Restore systems using clean, verified backups
4. **Lessons Learned:** Document findings and update security controls
5. **Communication:** Notify affected parties and regulatory bodies as required

### Post-Incident Activities
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Perform detailed analysis to identify underlying causes
- **Control Updates:** Implement additional controls to prevent similar incidents
- **Training Updates:** Update security training based on incident lessons
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Report incidents to relevant regulatory bodies within required timelines

## Compliance and Audit

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR/CCPA:** Implement data protection measures for personal data processing
- **SOX/PCI:** Meet financial and payment card industry compliance requirements
- **HIPAA:** Ensure healthcare data protection for applicable functions
- **Industry Standards:** Adhere to relevant industry security frameworks

### Audit Requirements
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct quarterly security audits of serverless environments
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
- **Configuration Reviews:** Audit function configurations against security baselines
- **Access Reviews:** Conduct periodic reviews of access permissions and roles

## Development and Deployment Security

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations from initial design phase
- **Threat Modeling:** Perform threat modeling for all new serverless applications
- **Security Testing:** Include security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies

### Deployment Controls
- **Automated Security Checks:** Implement security gates in deployment pipelines
- **Immutable Deployments:** Use immutable deployment practices to prevent tampering
- **Rollback Procedures:** Maintain ability to quickly rollback insecure deployments
- **Environment Separation:** Maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production

## Third-Party and Supply Chain Security

### Vendor Assessment
- **Security Reviews:** Assess cloud platform security controls and certifications
- **Contract Requirements:** Include security requirements in vendor contracts
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor vendor security posture and incident reports
- **Exit Strategies:** Plan for secure migration away from compromised vendors

### Supply Chain Protection
- **Code Supply Chain:** Secure the software supply chain from development to deployment
- **Infrastructure Supply Chain:** Verify integrity of infrastructure and platform updates
- **Third-Party Components:** Vet all third-party libraries and services for security

## Training and Awareness

### Security Training
- **Developer Training:** Mandatory security training for all serverless developers
- **Awareness Programs:** Regular security awareness communications and updates
- **Specialized Training:** Advanced training for security team members
- **Certification Requirements:** Require relevant security certifications for key roles

### Knowledge Management
- **Security Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive security documentation and runbooks
- **Best Practices Sharing:** Regularly share security lessons and best practices
- **Community Participation:** Participate in security communities and share threat intelligence

## Policy Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Automated Enforcement:** Use policy-as-code to automatically enforce security controls
