# Transportation EV Infrastructure Safety Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes safety standards and operational requirements for electric vehicle charging infrastructure to ensure public safety, equipment reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all EV charging stations, including public, workplace, and residential installations owned, operated, or maintained by the transportation authority.

## Safety Standards

### Electrical Safety Requirements
- All charging equipment must meet UL 2594 and IEEE 1547 standards
- Ground fault protection required on all circuits
- Emergency shutoff capabilities within 10 seconds of activation
- Surge protection for voltage spikes up to 20kV

### Fire Prevention Measures
- Minimum 3-foot clearance around charging equipment
- Fire-rated enclosures for indoor installations
- Automatic fire suppression systems for high-power stations (>150kW)
- Prohibited installation near flammable materials

### Physical Security
- Vandalism-resistant equipment design
- 24/7 video surveillance at public stations
- Emergency call boxes within 100 feet of stations
- Access control for restricted charging areas

## Operational Requirements

### Maintenance Protocols
- Monthly visual inspections of all equipment
- Quarterly electrical testing and calibration
- Annual comprehensive safety audits
- Immediate repair of any identified hazards

### Emergency Response
- 24/7 monitoring center for system alerts
- Emergency shutdown procedures documented and tested quarterly
- Coordination with local fire and emergency services
- Public emergency notification system

### User Safety Training
- Safety instructions posted at all stations
- Online safety training for maintenance personnel
- Public education campaigns on EV charging safety
- Emergency contact information prominently displayed

## Regulatory Compliance

### Certification Requirements

- Annual inspection by certified electrical inspectors
- Compliance with ADA accessibility standards
- Environmental impact assessments for new installations

### Reporting Obligations
- Monthly safety incident reports to regulatory authorities
- Immediate reporting of accidents or equipment failures
- Annual safety performance summary to stakeholders
- Public disclosure of safety records

## Risk Management

### Hazard Identification
- Regular risk assessments of all charging locations
- Weather-related vulnerability evaluations
- Cybersecurity threat assessments
- Capacity overload prevention measures

### Incident Response

- Annual safety training and certification renewal
- Emergency response training for all employees
- Specialized training for high-voltage equipment

### Public Communication
- Safety guidelines distributed through multiple channels
- Regular safety awareness campaigns
- Transparent incident reporting and resolution
- Community engagement for safety concerns

## Monitoring and Enforcement

### Performance Metrics
- Zero tolerance for safety violations
- 99.5% equipment uptime requirement
- Response time under 15 minutes for safety issues
- Annual safety audit compliance rate of 100%

### Non-Compliance Consequences
- Immediate shutdown of non-compliant equipment
- Financial penalties for repeated violations
- Mandatory retraining for responsible personnel
- Potential revocation of operating licenses

## Review and Updates
- Annual policy review by safety committee
- Updates required for new technology or regulations
- Stakeholder input incorporated in revision process
- Training programs updated within 30 days of policy changes
