# Transportation Hyperloop Safety Certification Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive safety standards and certification requirements for hyperloop transportation systems, ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all hyperloop system design, construction, testing, and operations, including pod vehicles, guideway infrastructure, propulsion systems, and control centers.

## Policy Statement

### Safety Certification Framework
1. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Meet or exceed all applicable national and international transportation safety standards
   - Obtain certifications from relevant regulatory bodies (FAA, DOT, equivalent international agencies)
   - Maintain compliance with evolving safety regulations and standards

2. **Independent Safety Assessment**
   - Conduct third-party safety audits annually
   - Implement Safety Management System (SMS) certified to ISO 45001
   - Regular safety case reviews and updates

3. **Technology Readiness Levels**
   - Achieve Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 9 for all critical systems before passenger operations
   - Maintain comprehensive failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) documentation
   - Implement redundant safety systems with proven reliability

### System Safety Requirements
