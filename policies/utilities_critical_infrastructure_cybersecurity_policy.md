# Utilities Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Policy

## Policy Overview
This policy establishes cybersecurity requirements for protecting critical utility infrastructure from cyber threats, ensuring reliable service delivery and compliance with federal regulations.

## Scope
Applies to all IT systems, OT networks, physical security systems, and third-party vendors supporting utility operations.

## Cybersecurity Framework

### Access Control
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all administrative access to critical systems
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access limited to job function requirements
- **Remote Access**: VPN required for all external connections, with session monitoring

### Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Critical OT networks isolated from corporate IT networks
- **Firewall Protection**: Next-generation firewalls with intrusion prevention
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of network traffic for anomalies

### Endpoint Protection
- **Antivirus/Anti-malware**: Real-time protection on all endpoints
- **Patch Management**: Critical security patches applied within 30 days
- **Device Encryption**: Full disk encryption for all mobile devices and laptops

## Incident Response

### Detection and Analysis
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: 24/7 monitoring of security events
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Network and host-based intrusion detection
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration of industry and government threat intelligence

### Response Procedures
- **Incident Classification**: Immediate classification as critical, high, medium, or low
- **Response Teams**: Dedicated cybersecurity incident response team
- **Communication Protocols**: Pre-defined notification procedures for stakeholders

### Recovery and Lessons Learned
- **Business Continuity Plans**: Tested annually for cyber incident scenarios
- **System Recovery**: Documented procedures for system restoration
- **Post-Incident Review**: Analysis of all incidents with improvement recommendations

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- **NERC CIP Standards**: Compliance with all applicable critical infrastructure protection standards
- **CISA Guidelines**: Adherence to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommendations
- **State Regulations**: Compliance with state-specific utility cybersecurity requirements

### Internal Audits
- **Quarterly Assessments**: Internal security assessments of all systems
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Monthly automated vulnerability scans
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party penetration testing

### Third-Party Risk Management
- **Vendor Assessment**: Cybersecurity assessment of all critical vendors
- **Contract Requirements**: Security requirements in all vendor contracts
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of vendor security posture

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
- **Security Awareness Training**: Annual training for all employees
- **Role-Specific Training**: Specialized training for IT and OT personnel
- **Phishing Simulations**: Quarterly phishing awareness campaigns

### Contractor and Visitor Requirements
- **Background Checks**: Security clearance for contractors with system access
- **Training Requirements**: Cybersecurity training for all contractors
- **Access Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of contractor system access

## Physical Security Integration

### Facility Security
- **Access Controls**: Biometric and card access to critical facilities
- **Surveillance Systems**: 24/7 video monitoring of critical infrastructure
- **Environmental Controls**: Climate control and fire suppression systems

### Supply Chain Security
- **Vendor Verification**: Security assessment of equipment suppliers
- **Hardware Integrity**: Verification of hardware supply chain integrity
- **Secure Delivery**: Controlled delivery and installation procedures

## Continuous Improvement

### Performance Metrics
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Target < 24 hours
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Target < 4 hours
- **Security Incident Rate**: Target < 2 per year

### Technology Updates
- **Annual Review**: Security technologies and procedures reviewed annually
- **Emerging Threats**: Monitoring of new cyber threats and required responses
- **Budget Allocation**: Minimum 8% of IT budget allocated to cybersecurity

## Enforcement

### Violation Consequences
- **Policy Violations**: Progressive discipline up to termination
- **Security Incidents**: Immediate investigation and potential legal action
- **Non-Compliance**: Corrective action plans with deadlines
- **Third-Party Breaches**: Contract termination and regulatory reporting

### Monitoring and Auditing
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated systems for policy compliance
- **Regular Audits**: Quarterly security audits with external validation
- **Incident Tracking**: All violations logged and trended for improvement

### Reporting
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Hotline for reporting security concerns
- **Mandatory Reporting**: Immediate reporting of suspected security incidents
- **Executive Reporting**: Monthly security status reports to executive leadership
