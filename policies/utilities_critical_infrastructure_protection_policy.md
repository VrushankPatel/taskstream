# Utilities Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for protecting critical utility infrastructure from physical and cyber threats, ensuring reliable service delivery and compliance with federal regulations.

## Scope
Applies to all utility operations including power generation, transmission, distribution, water treatment, and supporting IT systems across all facilities and remote assets.

## Policy Objectives
- Maintain 99.97% service reliability (target uptime)
- Prevent unauthorized access to critical systems
- Ensure rapid recovery from disruptions
- Comply with NERC CIP, CISA guidelines, and state regulations

## Risk Management Framework

### Threat Assessment
- **Physical Threats**: Unauthorized access, vandalism, natural disasters
- **Cyber Threats**: Malware, ransomware, DDoS attacks, insider threats
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Third-party vendor vulnerabilities
- **Human Factors**: Social engineering, accidental damage

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Access Control**
   - Multi-factor authentication for all critical systems
   - Role-based access with principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews and revocation procedures

2. **Network Security**
   - Segmented networks isolating critical infrastructure
   - Continuous monitoring and intrusion detection
   - Encrypted communications for all control systems

3. **Physical Security**
   - Perimeter security with surveillance systems
   - Controlled access to substations and facilities
   - Security personnel and emergency response protocols

## Incident Response Procedures

### Detection and Assessment
- Automated monitoring alerts for anomalies
- 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring
- Incident classification: Low, Medium, High, Critical

### Response Protocols
- **Critical Incidents**: Immediate isolation and notification within 15 minutes
- **High Priority**: Response within 1 hour, executive notification
- **Coordination**: Internal response team activation, external agency notification as required

### Recovery and Lessons Learned
- Documented recovery procedures for all critical systems
- Post-incident reviews within 72 hours
- Annual simulation exercises and policy updates

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements
- NERC CIP standards compliance
- CISA cybersecurity framework adoption
- State-specific infrastructure protection regulations
- Annual third-party security assessments

### Internal Controls
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Security awareness training for all employees
- Audit trails for all critical system access

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
- Mandatory cybersecurity awareness annually
- Role-specific training for critical infrastructure personnel
- Incident response drills bi-annually
- Third-party vendor security requirements

### Communication
- Regular security updates and threat intelligence sharing
- Emergency contact lists and notification procedures
- Stakeholder communication protocols for incidents

## Continuous Improvement

### Performance Metrics
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for security incidents
- Incident response time metrics
- Compliance audit results
- Employee training completion rates

### Policy Review
- Annual policy review and updates
- Incorporation of emerging threats and technologies
- Benchmarking against industry best practices
- Executive oversight committee quarterly reviews

## Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Critical infrastructure protection is essential to public safety and company operations.
