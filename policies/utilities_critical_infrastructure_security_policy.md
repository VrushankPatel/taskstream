   - Data classification and handling procedures
   - Incident reporting requirements
   - Third-party vendor assessments

### Operational Resilience
1. **Risk Assessment**
   - Regular vulnerability assessments
   - Threat intelligence monitoring
   - Business impact analysis
   - Emergency preparedness exercises

2. **Business Continuity**
   - Backup power systems for critical facilities
   - Alternative routing for critical services
   - Mutual aid agreements with other utilities
   - Emergency communication protocols

3. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Vendor risk assessments
   - Critical component inventory management
   - Alternative sourcing strategies
   - Quality assurance procedures

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Regulatory Compliance
- Adherence to NERC CIP standards for electrical infrastructure
- Compliance with DHS Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards
- EPA water sector security requirements
- FCC telecommunications security guidelines

### Monitoring and Auditing
1. **Regular Assessments**
   - Annual security audits by independent third parties
   - Quarterly self-assessments by facility managers
   - Continuous monitoring of security systems

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Security incident response time (<15 minutes)
   - Access control violation rate (<1%)
   - Cybersecurity threat detection rate (>95%)
   - Emergency drill completion rate (100%)

### Incident Response
1. **Reporting Requirements**
   - Immediate notification of security incidents
   - Regulatory reporting within required timeframes
   - Internal incident response team activation

2. **Investigation and Remediation**
   - Root cause analysis for all incidents
   - Corrective action implementation
   - Lessons learned documentation
