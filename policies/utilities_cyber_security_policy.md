# Utilities Cyber Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes cybersecurity requirements for protecting critical infrastructure, sensitive data, and operational technology systems in the utilities sector.

## Scope
Applies to all information systems, operational technology, physical security systems, and third-party vendors supporting utility operations including generation, transmission, distribution, and customer service functions.

## Risk Management Framework

### Threat Assessment
- Continuous monitoring of emerging cyber threats specific to utilities sector
- Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
- Integration of threat intelligence from industry sharing programs

### Risk Prioritization
- Critical infrastructure protection focus on control systems and SCADA networks
- Data classification based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements
- Business impact analysis for cyber incident scenarios

## Technical Security Controls

### Network Security
- Network segmentation between IT and operational technology systems
- Multi-factor authentication for all privileged access
- Zero-trust architecture implementation across enterprise networks

### Endpoint Protection
- Advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) on all devices
- Regular security patching and vulnerability management
- Secure configuration standards for all systems and devices

### Access Control
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Just-in-time access for critical systems maintenance
- Regular access review and provisioning processes

## Operational Security

### Incident Response
- 24/7 cybersecurity operations center (SOC) monitoring
- Incident response team with defined roles and responsibilities
- Automated alerting and escalation procedures for security events

### Business Continuity
- Cyber incident response integration with business continuity plans
- Backup and recovery procedures for critical systems
- Alternative operational procedures for cyber-compromised scenarios

### Third-Party Risk Management
- Cybersecurity requirements in all vendor contracts
- Regular security assessments of critical suppliers
- Supply chain risk monitoring and mitigation

## Compliance and Reporting

### Regulatory Compliance
- NERC CIP standards compliance for bulk electric systems
- Regional cybersecurity regulations and reporting requirements
- Integration with national critical infrastructure protection frameworks

### Audit and Assessment
- Annual cybersecurity assessments by independent auditors
- Regular internal security control testing
- Penetration testing and red team exercises

### Performance Metrics
- Mean time to detect security incidents: Target <24 hours
- Mean time to respond to incidents: Target <4 hours
- Security control effectiveness: Target >95%

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
- Mandatory cybersecurity awareness training for all employees
- Role-specific training for IT and operations personnel
- Annual security awareness refreshers and phishing simulations

### Contractor Requirements
- Cybersecurity training requirements for all contractors and vendors
- Background checks for personnel with critical system access
- Security awareness verification processes

## Continuous Improvement

### Security Monitoring
- Security information and event management (SIEM) system implementation
- Log analysis and correlation for threat detection
- Performance monitoring of security controls

### Technology Refresh
- Regular evaluation of emerging security technologies
- Security architecture modernization planning
- Integration of AI and machine learning for threat detection

### Lessons Learned
- Post-incident reviews and security improvement implementation
- Regular updates to security policies based on threat landscape
- Sharing of security best practices across industry partners
