# Utilities Cybersecurity Framework Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for protecting critical utility infrastructure, ensuring operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and resilience against cyber threats.

## Scope
Applies to all information systems, operational technology, and digital assets supporting utility operations including power generation, transmission, distribution, and customer service systems.

## Cybersecurity Principles

### Defense in Depth
1. **Prevention**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Detection**: Continuous monitoring and threat identification
3. **Response**: Rapid incident containment and recovery
4. **Recovery**: Business continuity and system restoration
5. **Adaptation**: Continuous improvement based on lessons learned

### Risk-Based Approach
- **Asset Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low impact systems
- **Threat Assessment**: Regular evaluation of cyber threats and vulnerabilities
- **Impact Analysis**: Business impact assessment for security incidents
- **Resource Allocation**: Security investments based on risk priorities

## Security Controls Framework

### Access Management
**Identity and Access Control**
- Multi-factor authentication for all privileged accounts
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and automated deprovisioning
- Remote access through secure VPN with endpoint verification

**Account Management**
- Unique user accounts with complex password requirements
- Automated password expiration and history enforcement
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Emergency access procedures for critical systems

### Network Security
**Network Segmentation**
- Critical infrastructure isolated from business networks
- Demilitarized zones (DMZ) for internet-facing systems
- Micro-segmentation for sensitive data zones
- Zero trust architecture implementation

**Traffic Protection**
- Next-generation firewalls with application awareness
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems
- DDoS protection and traffic filtering
- Encrypted communications for all data in transit

### Endpoint Protection
**Device Security**
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) on all devices
- Antivirus/antimalware with real-time scanning
- Device encryption and secure boot requirements
- Mobile device management (MDM) for company devices

**Remote Work Security**
- Secure access solutions for remote workers
- Endpoint verification before network access
- Data loss prevention (DLP) for sensitive information
- Regular security awareness training

### Data Protection
**Information Classification**
- Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted data categories
- Automated data classification and labeling
- Encryption requirements based on data sensitivity
- Data handling procedures for each classification

**Data Security Measures**
- Database encryption for sensitive customer and operational data
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Data masking for non-production environments
- Secure data disposal procedures

## Operational Technology Security

- Annual cybersecurity program review
- Incident reports within 24 hours

**External Reporting**
- Regulatory notifications for reportable incidents
- Law enforcement coordination for criminal activity
- Industry information sharing through ISACs
- Customer notifications for data breaches

## Third-Party Risk Management

### Vendor Assessment
**Due Diligence**
- Cybersecurity questionnaire for all vendors
- Third-party risk assessments for critical suppliers
- Contractual security requirements
- Right to audit clauses in agreements

### Supply Chain Security
**Hardware and Software**
- Secure development practices verification
- Software bill of materials (SBOM) requirements
- Open source component vulnerability scanning
- Firmware update procedures

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
**Security Awareness**
- Annual cybersecurity training for all employees (100% completion required)
- Phishing simulation exercises quarterly
- Role-specific training for technical staff
- Incident response training for key personnel
- AI ethics and security training for ML/AI users

### Specialized Training
**Technical Training**
- Network security for IT staff
