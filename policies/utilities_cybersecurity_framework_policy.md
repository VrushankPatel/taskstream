# Utilities Cybersecurity Framework Policy

## Policy Overview
**Effective Date:** April 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** August 15, 2025
**Scope:** All information systems, operational technology, and physical security controls
**Objective:** Establish comprehensive cybersecurity framework to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats

## Purpose
This policy defines the cybersecurity framework for protecting utility operations, ensuring the reliability and security of critical infrastructure. It addresses the unique challenges of securing both IT and OT environments in the energy sector.

## Core Principles

### Defense in Depth

- **Level 3**: Major incidents with potential operational impact
- **Level 4**: Critical incidents requiring emergency response

### Response Process
1. **Detection and Analysis**: Initial triage and impact assessment
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
3. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and validate security
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

### Communication Protocols
- **Internal Notification**: Immediate alert to cybersecurity team
- **Executive Notification**: C-suite notification within 1 hour for major incidents
- **External Reporting**: Regulatory reporting as required by NERC and DHS
- **Customer Communication**: Transparent communication for service impacts

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements
- **NERC CIP**: Critical infrastructure protection standards
- **DHS Requirements**: Federal cybersecurity mandates
- **State Regulations**: Local utility cybersecurity requirements

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
- **Annual Security Awareness**: Mandatory training for all employees
- **Role-Specific Training**: Specialized training for IT, OT, and security personnel
- **Phishing Simulations**: Regular testing of employee vigilance
- **Incident Response Drills**: Annual tabletop exercises

### Contractor and Vendor Requirements
- **Security Requirements**: Minimum security standards for third parties
- **Access Management**: Controlled access to systems and facilities
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of third-party activities
- **Contractual Obligations**: Security clauses in all vendor contracts

## Technology and Tools
