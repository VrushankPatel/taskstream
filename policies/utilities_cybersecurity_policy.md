# Utilities Cybersecurity Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for protecting the utility's critical infrastructure, operational technology (OT), and information technology (IT) systems from cyber threats. It ensures reliable service delivery, protects customer data, and maintains regulatory compliance.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties accessing utility systems, including:
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
- Distribution Management Systems (DMS)
- Smart grid infrastructure and IoT devices
- Corporate IT networks and data systems
- Third-party vendor access to critical systems

## Policy Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls across all systems
- Network segmentation between IT and OT environments
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Zero-trust architecture implementation

### 2. Risk-Based Security
- Prioritization of security controls based on criticality and risk
- Regular risk assessments for all systems and processes
- Cost-benefit analysis for security investments
- Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence integration

### 3. Compliance and Standards
- Adherence to NERC CIP standards for critical infrastructure
- Compliance with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Regular audits and compliance reporting
- Integration with regional cybersecurity coordination

## Security Controls

### Access Management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access limited to job requirements with principle of least privilege
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all remote access and privileged accounts
- **Access Reviews**: Quarterly review of user access rights and removal of unnecessary privileges
- **Vendor Access**: Strict controls on third-party access with contractual security requirements

### Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Physical and logical separation of OT and IT networks
- **Firewall Management**: Next-generation firewalls with application-aware filtering
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention**: 24/7 monitoring of network traffic for anomalous activity
- **Remote Access**: Secure VPN connections with endpoint verification

### Endpoint Protection
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Advanced threat detection on all endpoints
- **Patch Management**: Automated patching with priority for critical vulnerabilities
- **Device Management**: Centralized management of all connected devices including IoT
- **Mobile Device Security**: Containerization and remote wipe capabilities

### Incident Response
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for cyber incident management
- **24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Continuous monitoring and initial response
- **Coordination Protocols**: Integration with government agencies and industry partners
- **Communication Plans**: Stakeholder notification procedures and regulatory reporting

## Operational Technology Security

### SCADA System Protection
- **Air-Gapping**: Physical isolation of critical control systems where feasible
- **Secure Protocols**: Use of encrypted and authenticated industrial protocols
- **Change Management**: Strict controls on system modifications and updates
- **Backup and Recovery**: Secure backups with tested restoration procedures

### Smart Grid Security
- **Device Authentication**: Mutual authentication for all grid-connected devices
- **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for grid communications
- **Firmware Security**: Secure boot and firmware update processes
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of hardware and software supply chain integrity

## Data Protection
- **Data Classification**: Classification of sensitive operational and customer data
- **Encryption Standards**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Monitoring and prevention of sensitive data exfiltration
- **Retention Policies**: Secure deletion of data beyond retention requirements

## Third-Party Risk Management
- **Vendor Assessment**: Comprehensive security assessments for critical vendors
- **Contractual Requirements**: Security clauses in all vendor contracts
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of vendor security posture
- **Incident Notification**: Requirements for vendor breach notification

## Training and Awareness
- **Security Awareness Training**: Annual training for all employees and contractors covering cybersecurity fundamentals, password hygiene, and incident reporting. Completion rate tracked at 95% with mandatory refresher courses for non-compliance.
- **Role-Specific Training**: Specialized training for IT, OT, and security personnel including vendor-specific system training, regulatory compliance requirements, and advanced threat recognition. Certification requirements for critical roles.
- **Phishing Awareness**: Monthly simulated phishing exercises with immediate feedback and remediation training. Target: <5% click rate on simulated attacks.
- **Incident Response Drills**: Annual tabletop exercises and bi-annual full-scale simulations. All drills documented with lessons learned and process improvements implemented within 30 days.

## Monitoring and Reporting
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging and correlation
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Regular reporting on security metrics
- **Audit and Compliance**: Annual third-party audits and regulatory reporting
- **Executive Reporting**: Monthly security dashboard for senior management

## Enforcement
- **Policy Violations**: Progressive discipline for policy non-compliance
- **Security Incidents**: Investigation and remediation of security violations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular policy reviews and updates based on threat landscape
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility for security controls

## Contact Information
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Policy oversight and approval
- **Security Operations Center**: security@utility.com, 24/7 hotline: 1-800-SECURE
- **Compliance Officer**: Regulatory compliance and reporting

This policy is reviewed annually or following significant security incidents. All employees are required to acknowledge understanding of this policy annually.
