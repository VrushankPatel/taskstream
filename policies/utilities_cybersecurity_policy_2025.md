# Utilities Cybersecurity Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes the framework for protecting critical infrastructure systems from cyber threats, ensuring operational reliability, and maintaining compliance with NERC CIP and other cybersecurity regulations.

## Scope
Applies to all IT systems, operational technology (OT), industrial control systems (ICS), and third-party connections supporting electric, gas, and water utility operations.

## Risk Management Framework

### Threat Assessment
- Annual cybersecurity risk assessment  
- Continuous threat intelligence monitoring  
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing  
- Supply chain risk evaluation  

### Critical Asset Identification
- Bulk Electric System (BES) Cyber Systems  
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems  
- Distribution Management Systems (DMS)  
- Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)  

## Access Control

### Authentication Requirements
- Multi-factor authentication for all remote access  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation  
- Least privilege principle for system access  
- Regular access review and recertification  

### Network Segmentation
- Physical separation of IT and OT networks

- Contractual security requirements  
- Regular vendor risk assessments  
- Incident notification obligations  

### Supply Chain Security
- Secure software development practices  
- Third-party access monitoring  
- Configuration management for vendor systems  

## Employee Training and Awareness

### Security Training
- Annual cybersecurity awareness training for all employees  
- Role-specific technical training for IT/OT personnel  
- Phishing simulation exercises quarterly  
- Incident response training for key personnel  

### Reporting Obligations
- Mandatory reporting of suspicious activities  
- Protection from retaliation for good-faith reports  
- Clear channels for security concerns  

## Physical Security

### Facility Access
- Secure server room and control center access  
- Visitor management and escort procedures  
- CCTV monitoring of critical areas  
- Access logging and audit trails  

### Mobile Device Security
- Mobile device management (MDM) policies
