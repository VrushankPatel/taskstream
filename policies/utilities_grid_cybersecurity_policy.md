# Utilities Grid Cybersecurity Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes cybersecurity requirements for protecting the electrical grid infrastructure from cyber threats, ensuring reliable service delivery, and maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.

## Scope
Applies to all grid operations, control systems, communication networks, and supporting IT infrastructure managed by the utility company.

## Policy Principles

### Risk Management
- Conduct annual cybersecurity risk assessments
- Implement defense-in-depth security architecture
- Maintain incident response capabilities for cyber events
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication for all remote access
- Role-based access controls with least privilege principle
- Regular access reviews and credential management
- Secure remote access solutions for vendor and contractor access

### Network Security
- Network segmentation between IT and operational technology (OT) systems
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Regular security patching and updates
- Encrypted communications for sensitive data transmission

### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive operational data at rest and in transit
- Secure data backup and recovery procedures
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Compliance with data privacy regulations

## Operational Controls

### Monitoring and Detection
- 24/7 security operations center (SOC) monitoring
- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities
- Regular log review and analysis

### Incident Response
- Established cyber incident response team
- Documented incident response procedures
- Regular tabletop exercises and simulations
- Coordination with external cybersecurity agencies

### Third-Party Risk Management
- Vendor security assessments before contract award
- Contractual cybersecurity requirements for suppliers
- Regular third-party security audits
- Supply chain risk monitoring

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
- Adherence to NERC CIP standards
- Compliance with regional cybersecurity regulations
- Regular regulatory reporting and audits
- Participation in information sharing programs

### Internal Auditing
- Quarterly cybersecurity control assessments
- Annual independent security audits
- Management reviews of security metrics
- Continuous improvement based on audit findings

## Training and Awareness

### Employee Training
- Mandatory annual cybersecurity awareness training
- Role-specific technical training for IT and OT staff
- Phishing simulation exercises
- Incident reporting procedures training

### Contractor Requirements
- Cybersecurity training for all contractors
- Background checks for critical access personnel
- Security awareness briefings for site visits

## Emerging Technologies and Innovation

### AI and Machine Learning

- Supply chain security for hardware components

## Enforcement and Consequences

### Policy Violations
- Immediate suspension of access for policy violations
- Disciplinary action up to termination for serious breaches
- Legal action for intentional security compromises
- Contract termination for vendor violations

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular policy reviews and updates
- Incorporation of emerging threat intelligence
- Benchmarking against industry best practices
- Technology refresh to address evolving threats
