# Utilities Smart Grid Security Policy

## Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements and procedures for the design, implementation, and operation of smart grid systems to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats, ensure reliable power delivery, and maintain regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to all smart grid components including smart meters, distribution automation systems, substation automation, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), and associated communication networks.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls implemented across all system components
- No single point of failure in security architecture
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Zero Trust Architecture
- All network traffic verified and authenticated
- Least privilege access principles applied
- Continuous monitoring and validation of all connections

### Risk-Based Security
- Security controls proportional to identified risks
- Critical assets receive highest protection levels
- Regular risk assessments drive security improvements

## Security Requirements

### Network Security
- **Segmentation**: Smart grid networks isolated from corporate IT networks
- **Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest encrypted using FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms
- **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication required for all remote access
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 network traffic monitoring with intrusion detection systems

### Device Security
- **Smart Meters**: Tamper-resistant hardware with secure boot capabilities
- **Firmware Updates**: Secure over-the-air update mechanisms with rollback capabilities
- **Physical Security**: Meters and infrastructure protected against physical attacks

### Data Protection
- **Privacy**: Customer data anonymized and aggregated to prevent identification
- **Integrity**: Data integrity checks implemented for all critical measurements
- **Retention**: Data retention policies comply with regulatory requirements

### Incident Response
- **Detection**: Automated alerting for security anomalies within 5 minutes
- **Response**: Incident response team activated within 15 minutes of detection
- **Recovery**: System restoration procedures tested quarterly
- **Reporting**: Regulatory reporting within 24 hours of significant incidents

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Standards
- **NERC CIP**: Compliance with North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of NIST CSF across all smart grid operations
- **IEC 62351**: Adherence to IEC standards for power system management and information exchange

### Audit and Assessment
- **Annual Audits**: Independent security audits conducted annually
- **Vulnerability Assessments**: Quarterly vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- **Compliance Reporting**: Monthly reporting to regulatory authorities

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- Overall responsibility for smart grid security program
- Approves security policies and major security investments
- Reports security status to executive leadership and board

### Smart Grid Security Manager

## Training and Awareness
- **Annual Training**: All personnel receive security awareness training annually
- **Role-Specific Training**: Technical staff receive specialized security training
- **Incident Response Drills**: Quarterly drills to maintain response readiness

## Policy Review and Updates
- This policy reviewed annually or following significant security incidents
- Updates approved by executive leadership and legal counsel
- All changes communicated to affected personnel

## Enforcement
- Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action up to termination
- Security violations reported to regulatory authorities as required
- Continuous monitoring ensures policy adherence
