**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Focus on underrepresented industries: Retail (expand to 220+ files), Hospitality (110+), Insurance (110+), Utilities (70+), Mining (70+), Agriculture (70+), Aerospace (70+)
2. Create more simple/medium complexity workflows to balance distribution (target 20/50/30)
3. Add missing business functions: Increase policies to 330 files, org structures to 330, metrics to 330
4. Improve content depth in: Communications (add risks/timelines), policies (add enforcement mechanisms), workflows (add decision points/tools)
5. Reduce technology dominance below 20% by expanding traditional sectors

**Successful Improvements:**
- Enhanced 5 files: added decision points, tools, outputs, follow-up actions, risks, lessons learned
- Improved content depth in hospitality, retail, healthcare, EU retail workflows and crisis communications
- Maintained 100% format compliance across all 2409 files
- Added realistic business details and professional terminology

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry significantly overrepresented at 43.7% (needs reduction to <20%)
- Need more simple/medium workflows in traditional industries
- Policies and org structures require expansion to 330 files each
- Geographic diversity limited (minimal EU/Asia content)
- Crisis management communications need expansion

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Maintain quality enhancement pace with 5-10 files per session
- Prioritize traditional industry content creation and technology reduction
- Focus on content depth, authenticity, and industry balance
- Add EU/Asia geographic scenarios and crisis management
- Track quality metrics and achieve balanced distribution

**Quality Score Improvement:** Stable at 97% (content enhancements improved depth and authenticity, format compliance maintained)
