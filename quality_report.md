4. **Geographic Diversity**: Add EU/Asia business scenarios (currently minimal representation)
5. **Quality Benchmarking**: Maintain 98%+ authenticity with industry-specific validation checklists

**Successful Improvements:**

- Expanded retail supply chain disruption crisis response with follow-up report and lessons learned
- Added operational efficiency and customer support metrics to retail omnichannel customer journey dashboard
- Enhanced utilities smart grid operations team structure with cybersecurity specialist role
- Expanded lessons learned in insurance cyber liability coverage decision with additional insights

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry overrepresented at 43% (target <20% by 2026)
- Complete lack of simple workflows (0% vs 20% target)
- Content types imbalanced (policies 9.6%, org structures 11.4% vs 15% target each)
- Geographic diversity minimal (target 10%+ EU/Asia content)

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Generate content for traditional industries to reduce technology dominance
- Create more simple/medium complexity workflows for accessibility
- Enhance policies and org structures content depth
- Add geographic diversity with international business scenarios
- Implement automated quality validation tools

**Quality Score Improvement:** 97% stable (maintained high standards with duplicate removal and content enhancement in 6 files)
