**Cross-Category Completeness Gaps:**
- Workflows missing policies: 700+ instances (significant gap)
- Workflows missing metrics: 700+ instances (significant gap)
- Decisions missing communications: 500+ instances (major gap)
- Orphaned org structures: 20+ instances
- Complete 6-category scenarios: <10% of total files

**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Prioritize cross-category completion for advanced_robotics, aerospace, agriculture workflows (add missing policies/metrics)
2. Focus QC on creating communication examples for decisions without documentation
3. Balance industry representation by reducing technology focus to <40% through targeted generation
4. Increase simple workflow distribution to meet 20% target
5. Enhance content depth in policies and org structures for enterprise scenario completeness
6. Address critical gaps in customer onboarding, compliance audit, and legal process scenarios
