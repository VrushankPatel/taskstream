- Accelerate traditional industry expansion to balance technology dominance
- Create more simple/medium workflows for better complexity distribution
- Enhance policies and org structures with enterprise details
- Add EU/Asia geographic diversity and international scenarios
- Maintain 100% format compliance and high authenticity standards
