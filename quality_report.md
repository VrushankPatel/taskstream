**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Focus on underrepresented industries: Retail, hospitality, insurance, utilities, mining, agriculture, aerospace to reduce technology dominance below 40%
2. Create more simple/medium complexity workflows (target 20% simple, 50% medium, 30% complex)
3. Add missing business functions: Crisis management, employee training, digital transformation scenarios
4. Improve content depth in policies (target 15%) and org structures (target 15%)
5. Enhance geographic diversity with more EU/Asia enterprise scenarios (target 20%+ each)

**Successful Improvements:**
- Fixed YAML block scalar syntax error in retail inventory workflow
- Enhanced retail EU customer loyalty enrollment workflow with GDPR compliance and communication metrics
- Expanded Asia hospitality guest feedback collection workflow with cultural adaptation and resolution metrics
- Improved insurance parametric risk assessment workflow with claims processing and satisfaction metrics
- Strengthened utilities renewable energy integration workflow with safety and efficiency metrics
- Enhanced retail simple inventory check workflow with training completion criteria

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry overrepresented at 43.1% (target <20%)
- Limited simple/medium complexity workflows
- Policies and org structures underrepresented
- Geographic diversity needs expansion

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Accelerate traditional industry expansion to balance technology dominance
- Create more simple/medium workflows for better complexity distribution
- Enhance policies and org structures with enterprise details
- Add EU/Asia geographic diversity and international scenarios
- Maintain 100% format compliance and high authenticity standards

**Quality Score Improvement:** 97% stable (maintained high standards with format fix and content enhancement in 5 files)
