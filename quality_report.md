- Workflows missing metrics: 700+ instances
- Decisions missing communications: 500+ instances
- Orphaned org structures: 20+ instances
- Complete 6-category scenarios: <10% of total files

**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Prioritize cross-category completion for advanced_robotics, aerospace, agriculture (high-value partial scenarios)
2. Focus QC on adding missing policies and metrics for existing workflows
3. Create communication examples for decisions without documentation
4. Balance industry representation by reducing technology focus to <40%
5. Increase simple/medium workflow complexity distribution to meet targets
6. Enhance content depth in policies and org structures for scenario completeness
