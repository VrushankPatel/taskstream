**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Focus on underrepresented industries: Retail (expand to 15%), Hospitality (10%), Insurance (10%), Utilities (5%), Mining (5%), Agriculture (5%), Aerospace (5%)
2. Create more simple/medium complexity workflows to reach 20/50/30 distribution
3. Add missing business functions: Policies (increase to 15%), Org Structures (15%)
4. Improve content depth in: Geographic diversity (EU/Asia to 20%+), Crisis management scenarios, Employee training workflows
5. Balance industry representation to reduce technology dominance below 30%

**Successful Improvements:**
- Fixed YAML syntax errors in 10 workflow files (indentation corrections)
- Enhanced workflows/hospitality_asia_feedback_collection_workflow.yaml with decision points, risks, and expanded metrics
- Improved workflows/retail_eu_loyalty_enrollment_workflow.yaml with risks and additional metrics
- Strengthened workflows/agriculture_eu_precision_farming_workflow.yaml with decision points and metrics
- Expanded workflows/utilities_asia_grid_maintenance_scheduling_workflow.yaml with risks and metrics
- Enhanced workflows/insurance_eu_claims_processing_workflow.yaml with decision points and metrics

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry overrepresented at 43% (target <30%)
- Limited simple/medium complexity workflows
- Policies and org structures underrepresented
- Minimal geographic diversity

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Accelerate traditional industry expansion to balance technology dominance
- Create more simple/medium workflows for better complexity distribution
- Enhance policies and org structures with enterprise details
- Add EU/Asia geographic diversity and international scenarios
- Maintain 100% format compliance and high authenticity standards

**Quality Score Improvement:** 97% maintained (format fixes and content enhancements in 15 files)
