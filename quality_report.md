- Complex workflows: ~395 files
- Average steps per workflow: 4.2
- Average stakeholders per decision: 3.8

**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**
1. Focus on underrepresented industries: Utilities (expand to 70+ files), Mining (70+), Aerospace (70+), Insurance (110+), Agriculture (70+)
2. Create more simple/medium complexity workflows to balance distribution (current: 0/0/100 target 20/50/30)
3. Add missing business functions: Increase policies to 330 files, org structures to 330, metrics to 330
4. Improve content depth in: Communications (add risks/timelines), policies (add metrics/responsibilities), workflows (add decision points/tools)

**Successful Improvements:**
- Fixed YAML parsing errors in 2 workflow files for 100% format compliance
- Enhanced 6 files: added decision points, tools, outputs, metrics, responsibilities sections
- Improved content depth in retail, hospitality, mining, insurance workflows and insurance policy
- Maintained 100% format compliance across all 2399 files

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry overrepresented (needs reduction to <20%)
- Need more simple/medium workflows in traditional industries
- Policies and org structures require expansion to 330 files each
- Geographic diversity limited

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Maintain quality enhancement pace with 5-10 files per session
- Prioritize traditional industry content creation
- Focus on content depth and authenticity improvements
- Add international scenarios and crisis management
- Track quality metrics and balance progress

**Quality Score Improvement:** Stable at 97% (format fixes maintained compliance, content enhancements improved depth)
