**Recommendations for Next Generation Session:**

4. Expand policies and org structures to 250+ files each
5. Add geographic diversity with EU/Asia business scenarios (target 15% international)
6. Enhance crisis management and employee training content
7. Develop cross-industry digital transformation scenarios

**Successful Improvements:**
- Fixed YAML parsing errors in 2 workflow files for 100% format compliance
- Enhanced 5 files: added decision points, success metrics, enforcement sections, data visualizations
- Improved content depth in retail, hospitality, insurance, aerospace, and agriculture files
- Maintained 100% format compliance across all 2374 files

**Quality Concerns Remaining:**
- Technology industry significantly overrepresented (55% vs target <20%)
- Need more simple/medium workflows in traditional industries
- Policies and org structures require expansion
- Geographic diversity limited to minimal international content

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Maintain quality enhancement pace with 5-10 files per session
- Prioritize traditional industry content creation
- Focus on content depth and authenticity improvements
