    - Performance monitoring tools
    - Audit documentation
    duration: 3 days
    outputs:
    - Validation report
    - Operational approval
    - Monitoring baseline
  success_criteria: Zero safety incidents in first 90 days, 95% training completion,
    99% safety system uptime
  failure_modes:
  - Incomplete risk assessment
  - Inadequate safety system design
  - Insufficient training
  - Poor system installation
  metrics:
  - 'Safety incident rate: Target <0.1 per 1,000 hours'
  - 'Training completion: Target 95%'
  - 'System uptime: Target 99%'
  - 'Risk mitigation effectiveness: Target 100%'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 85% (2023) → 92% (2024) → 95% (2025)
    cost_trend: $45K (2023) → $38K (2024) → $32K (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - Digital risk assessment reduced time by 40%
    - Automated monitoring improved detection by 60%
    - Standardized protocols reduced errors by 30%
