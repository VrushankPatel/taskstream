    historical_evolution: "Evolved from manual checklists to automated safety verification systems"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      actor: "Robot Operator"
      action: "Perform visual inspection of safety sensors and barriers"
      tools: ["Safety checklist app", "Visual inspection tools"]
      duration: "5 minutes"
      outputs: ["Inspection report"]
     - step: 2
       actor: "Safety Officer"
       action: "Verify emergency stop functionality and safety protocols"
       tools: ["Safety monitoring system"]
       duration: "5 minutes"
