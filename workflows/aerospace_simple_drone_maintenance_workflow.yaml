  title: Drone Maintenance and Inspection Workflow
  department: Aerospace Operations
  complexity: simple
  participants:
  - Drone Technician
  - Quality Inspector
  - Operations Manager
  trigger: Scheduled maintenance cycle or post-flight inspection
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2022-11-20'
    last_updated: '2025-09-30'
    typical_cycle_time: 30 minutes
    average_annual_executions: 500
    seasonal_variations:
    - Q2/Q3 peak operations
    - Q4 weather-related checks
    historical_evolution: Transitioned from paper logs to digital maintenance tracking
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Drone Technician
    action: Conduct pre-flight visual inspection and system diagnostics
    tools:
    - Diagnostic software
    - Inspection checklist
    duration: 15 minutes
    outputs:
    - Inspection report
    decision_points:
    - Diagnostic failure criteria
    - Visual inspection issues
  - step: 2
    actor: Quality Inspector
    action: Verify compliance with safety standards and log findings
    tools:
    - Quality assurance database
    duration: 10 minutes
    outputs:
    - Compliance certificate
    decision_points:
    - Compliance standards met
    - Safety violations detected
  - step: 3
    actor: Operations Manager
    action: Approve maintenance completion and schedule next inspection
    tools:
    - Maintenance scheduling system
    duration: 5 minutes
    outputs:
    - Maintenance schedule update
    decision_points:
    - Maintenance scheduling priorities
    - Next inspection timeline
  success_criteria: Drone passes all inspections and is certified for operation
  failure_modes:
  - Component failure detected
  - Calibration out of spec
  metrics:
  - 'Maintenance completion rate: 95%'
  - 'Average downtime: 30 minutes'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 92% (2023) → 94% (2024) → 95% (2025)
    cost_trend: $75K (2023) → $70K (2024) → $65K (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - Automated diagnostics reduced inspection time by 25%
    - Digital logging improved tracking by 30%
