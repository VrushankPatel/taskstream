  title: Agriculture Precision Crop Monitoring and Intervention
  department: Farm Operations
  complexity: medium
  participants:
  - Farm Manager
  - Agronomist
  - Equipment Operator
  trigger: Automated sensor alerts or scheduled monitoring cycle
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Farm Manager
    action: Review sensor data and identify crop stress indicators
    tools:
    - Precision Ag Platform
    - Weather Station Data
    duration: 30 minutes
    outputs:
    - Crop Health Assessment
  - step: 2
    actor: Agronomist
    action: Analyze data and recommend specific interventions
    duration: 1 hour
    outputs:
    - Intervention Plan
  - step: 3
    actor: Equipment Operator
    action: Execute precision interventions (irrigation, fertilization)
    tools:
    - GPS-guided Equipment
    - Variable Rate Technology
    duration: 2-4 hours
    outputs:
    - Intervention Records
    - Updated Crop Maps
  success_criteria: Crop stress addressed within optimal intervention window
  failure_modes:
  - Delayed response to alerts
  - Equipment breakdowns
  - Weather interference
  - Resource unavailability
  risks:
  - Weather delays
  - Sensor malfunction
  - Resource shortages
  - Environmental impact
  metrics:
  - 'Intervention response time: <6 hours for critical alerts'
  - 'Yield impact: 5-10% improvement from precision interventions'
  - 'Resource utilization efficiency: 90%+'
