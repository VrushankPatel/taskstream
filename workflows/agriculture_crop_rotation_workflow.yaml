  title: "Crop Rotation Planning and Implementation"
  department: "Agricultural Operations"
  complexity: "medium"
  participants: ["Farm Manager", "Agronomist", "Field Supervisor", "Soil Scientist"]
  trigger: "End of harvest season or soil nutrient depletion indicators"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      actor: "Agronomist"
      action: "Analyze soil samples and nutrient levels from previous crop cycle"
      tools: ["Soil testing kit", "Laboratory analysis software"]
      duration: "2 weeks"
      outputs: ["Soil health report", "Nutrient deficiency assessment"]
    - step: 2
      actor: "Farm Manager"
      action: "Review historical crop performance data and market demand forecasts"
      tools: ["Farm management software", "Market analysis reports"]
      duration: "1 week"
      outputs: ["Crop selection criteria", "Rotation schedule draft"]
    - step: 3
      actor: "Agronomist"
      action: "Design crop rotation sequence considering soil health, pest management, and biodiversity"
      tools: ["Crop rotation planning software", "Pest management database"]
      duration: "3 days"
      outputs: ["Detailed rotation plan", "Pest control recommendations"]
    - step: 4
      actor: "Field Supervisor"
      action: "Coordinate equipment preparation and seed procurement for next crop cycle"
      tools: ["Equipment maintenance logs", "Supplier procurement system"]
      duration: "2 weeks"
      outputs: ["Equipment readiness report", "Seed procurement order"]
    - step: 5
      actor: "Soil Scientist"
      action: "Validate rotation plan against long-term soil sustainability goals"
      tools: ["Soil modeling software", "Sustainability assessment framework"]
      duration: "1 week"
      outputs: ["Sustainability validation report", "Final rotation approval"]
  success_criteria: "Soil health improvement of 15% and yield stability maintained"
  failure_modes: ["Poor soil analysis leading to nutrient imbalances", "Market demand misalignment", "Equipment availability delays"]
  metrics:
    - "Soil organic matter increase: 2-3% annually"
    - "Crop diversity index: Minimum 0.7"
    - "Pest incidence reduction: 20% year-over-year"
