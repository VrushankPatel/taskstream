  department: Supply Chain & Quality Assurance
  complexity: complex
  participants:
  - Supply Chain Manager
  - Quality Assurance Lead
  - Farm Operations Manager
  - IT Systems Administrator
  - Regulatory Compliance Officer
  trigger: New product batch entering supply chain or regulatory traceability requirement
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2022-03-01'
    last_updated: '2025-09-30'
    typical_cycle_time: 30 days
    average_annual_executions: 365
    seasonal_variations:
    - Q1 peak for harvest processing
    - Q3 low for off-season maintenance
    historical_evolution: Evolved from manual record-keeping to blockchain-based digital
      traceability system
  steps:
  - step: 1

    - Documentation templates
    - Audit preparation tools
    duration: 3 days
    outputs:
    - Compliance verification
    - Regulatory reports
    - Traceability certificates
  success_criteria: 100% traceability from farm to consumer, 99.5% data accuracy,
    full regulatory compliance
  failure_modes:
  - Data entry errors
  - System connectivity issues
  - Regulatory requirement changes
  - Supplier non-compliance
  metrics:
  - 'Traceability accuracy: Target 99.5%'
  - 'Response time to traceability queries: Target <24 hours'
  - 'Regulatory compliance rate: Target 100%'
  - 'System uptime: Target 99.9%'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 92% (2023) → 96% (2024) → 98% (2025)
    cost_trend: $120K (2023) → $95K (2024) → $78K (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - Blockchain implementation reduced verification time by 60%
