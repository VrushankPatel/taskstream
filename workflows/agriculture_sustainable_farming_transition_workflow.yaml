  success_criteria: "Successful transition with measurable improvements in soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration"
  failure_modes: ["Insufficient funding", "Resistance from farm staff", "Unfavorable weather conditions", "Lack of technical expertise"]
  metrics:
    - "Soil organic matter increase: Target 10-15% improvement"
    - "Biodiversity index: Target 20% increase in species diversity"
    - "Carbon sequestration: Target 2-3 tons CO2 per hectare annually"
    - "Water retention: Target 15% improvement in soil water holding capacity"
    - "Economic viability: Target maintained or improved profitability"
