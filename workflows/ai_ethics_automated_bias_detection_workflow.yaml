   success_criteria: "Automated system detects >95% of bias issues with <5% false positive rate"
   failure_modes: ["Inadequate bias coverage", "Technical implementation failures", "Regulatory non-compliance"]
   metrics:
     - "Bias Detection Rate: Target >95% of actual bias issues identified"
     - "False Positive Rate: Target <5% incorrect bias flags"
     - "Detection Speed: Target <1 hour for model assessment"
     - "Coverage Completeness: Target 100% of bias types monitored"
     - "Remediation Success: Target >90% bias issues resolved"
     - "Compliance Score: Target >98% regulatory alignment"
