  title: AI Ethics Bias Mitigation Workflow
  department: AI Ethics & Compliance
  complexity: medium
  participants:
  - AI Ethicists
  - Data Scientists
  - Legal Counsel
  - Diverse Stakeholder Representatives
  - Technical Implementation Team
  trigger: AI model deployment or significant model update requiring bias assessment
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: AI Ethicists
    action: Conduct initial bias audit and identify potential fairness concerns
    tools:
    - Bias detection frameworks
    - Fairlearn toolkit
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Bias assessment report
    - Risk prioritization matrix
  - step: 2
    actor: Data Scientists
    action: Analyze training data for representation gaps and sampling biases
    tools:
    - Data profiling tools
    - Statistical analysis software
    duration: 2 weeks
    outputs:
    - Data quality report
    - Bias mitigation recommendations
  - step: 3
    actor: Diverse Stakeholder Representatives
    action: Review bias assessment results and provide domain-specific context
    decision_points:
    - Acceptable bias thresholds
    - Impact on affected communities
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Stakeholder feedback document
    - Ethical guidelines alignment
  - step: 4
    actor: Technical Implementation Team
    action: Implement bias mitigation techniques and model adjustments
    tools:
    - Reweighting algorithms
    - Adversarial debiasing methods
    duration: 3 weeks
    outputs:
    - Mitigated model version
    - Implementation documentation
  - step: 5
    actor: AI Ethicists
    action: Validate mitigation effectiveness and conduct residual bias testing
    tools:
    - Fairness metrics
    - Disparate impact analysis
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Validation report
    - Ongoing monitoring recommendations
  - step: 6
    actor: Legal Counsel
    action: Review compliance with regulatory requirements and ethical standards
    decision_points:
    - Legal compliance status
    - Documentation sufficiency
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Compliance certification
    - Legal risk assessment
  success_criteria: Bias levels reduced to acceptable thresholds with documented mitigation
    strategies
  failure_modes:
  - Unresolvable bias issues
  - Stakeholder disagreement on mitigation approaches
  - Performance degradation from mitigation
