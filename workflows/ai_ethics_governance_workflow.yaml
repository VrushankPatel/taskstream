  title: AI Ethics Governance Workflow
  department: AI Ethics and Compliance
  complexity: medium
  participants:
  - AI Ethics Officer
  - Data Scientists
  - Legal
  - HR
  - Business Stakeholders
  trigger: New AI project initiation or existing system audit
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: "2023-01-10"
    last_updated: "2024-12-01"
    typical_cycle_time: "8-12 weeks per assessment"
    average_annual_executions: 45
    seasonal_variations: ["Q1 +40% new project assessments", "Q4 +25% system audits", "Summer -20% due to vacation schedules"]
    historical_evolution: "Automated bias detection tools introduced in 2024 reduced assessment time by 30% while improving accuracy from 85% to 96%"
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: AI Ethics Officer
    action: Conduct initial ethics impact assessment
    tools:
    - Ethics assessment frameworks
    - Bias detection tools
    duration: 2 weeks
    outputs:
    - Ethics impact report
    - Risk identification
  - step: 2
    actor: Data Scientists
    action: Perform bias and fairness analysis on datasets and models
    tools:
    - Bias detection algorithms
    - Fairness metrics
    duration: 3 weeks
    outputs:
    - Bias analysis report
    - Mitigation recommendations
  - step: 3
    actor: Legal
    action: Review compliance with AI regulations and data privacy laws
    decision_points:
    - Regulatory requirements
    - Data usage permissions
    duration: 2 weeks
    outputs:
    - Compliance assessment
    - Legal recommendations
  - step: 4
    actor: HR
    action: Assess workforce impact and training requirements
    tools:
    - Workforce impact analysis
    - Training frameworks
    duration: 2 weeks
    outputs:
    - Workforce impact report
    - Training plan
  - step: 5
    actor: Business Stakeholders
    action: Review and approve ethics governance framework
    decision_points:
    - Ethical acceptability

    - Implementation roadmap
  success_criteria: AI system deployed with comprehensive ethics oversight and monitoring
  failure_modes:
  - Unacceptable bias levels
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  - Stakeholder objections
  metrics:
  - 'Bias detection accuracy: Target >95%'
  - 'Regulatory compliance rate: Target 100%'
  - 'Ethics audit completion: Target quarterly'
  - 'Stakeholder satisfaction: Target >4/5'
  - 'Training completion rate: Target >90%'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: "82% (2023) → 89% (2024) → 94% (2025 target)"
    cost_trend: "$125,000 (2023) → $95,000 (2024) → $85,000 (2025 target)"
    efficiency_improvements: ["Automated bias detection reduced manual review time by 45%", "Standardized assessment framework improved consistency by 35%", "Cross-functional training reduced stakeholder review time by 25%", "AI-powered compliance checking improved accuracy by 28%"]
