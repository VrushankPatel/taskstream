  title: Autonomous Systems Urban Integration Workflow
  department: Operations & Deployment
  complexity: high
  participants:
  - Urban Planning Specialists
  - Safety Engineers
  - Local Government Liaisons
  - Technical Integration Teams
  - Community Relations
  trigger: Approval to deploy autonomous systems in urban environment requiring infrastructure
    and community integration
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Urban Planning Specialists
    action: Assess urban infrastructure compatibility and integration requirements
    tools:
    - Urban planning software
    - Infrastructure mapping tools
    duration: 3 weeks
    outputs:
    - Infrastructure assessment
    - Integration requirements
  - step: 2
    actor: Safety Engineers
    action: Conduct urban safety risk assessment and mitigation planning
    tools:
    - Risk assessment frameworks
    - Safety simulation tools
    duration: 4 weeks
    outputs:
    - Safety risk assessment
    - Mitigation strategies
    decision_points:
    - Risk tolerance levels
    - Safety thresholds
  - step: 3
    actor: Local Government Liaisons
    action: Coordinate with municipal authorities for permits and infrastructure access
    tools:
    - Permit management systems
    - Government communication platforms
    duration: 6 weeks
    outputs:
    - Permit approvals
    - Infrastructure access agreements
  - step: 4
    actor: Technical Integration Teams
    action: Implement system integration with urban infrastructure (traffic signals,
      sensors)
    tools:
    - Integration platforms
    - IoT connectivity tools
    duration: 8 weeks
    outputs:
    - Integrated systems
    - Connectivity protocols
  - step: 5
    actor: Community Relations
    action: Develop and execute community education and engagement programs
    tools:
    - Community outreach platforms
    - Education materials
    duration: 4 weeks
    outputs:
    - Community engagement plan
    - Education materials
  success_criteria: Autonomous systems successfully integrated into urban environment
    with community acceptance and operational safety
  failure_modes:
  - Infrastructure incompatibility
  - Community resistance
  - Regulatory delays
  - Technical integration failures
