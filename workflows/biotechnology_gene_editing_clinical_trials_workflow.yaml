  - Safety Monitoring Board
  trigger: Preclinical gene editing therapy shows promising results requiring human
    trials
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Principal Investigator
    action: Develop clinical trial protocol including gene editing methodology, patient
      selection criteria, and safety endpoints
    tools:
    - Clinical trial management software
    - Regulatory databases
    - Gene editing protocols
    duration: 4 weeks
    outputs:
    - IND application draft
    - Trial protocol document
    decision_points:
    - Target disease selection
    - Gene editing technique validation
  - step: 2
    actor: Regulatory Affairs Specialist
    action: Prepare and submit Investigational New Drug (IND) application to FDA including
      preclinical data and trial design
    tools:
    - FDA eCTD system
    - Regulatory submission software
    duration: 6 weeks
    outputs:
    - IND submission package
    - Regulatory correspondence
    decision_points:
    - IND acceptance criteria
    - Fast track designation eligibility
  - step: 3
    actor: Ethics Committee Member
    action: Review trial protocol for ethical considerations including informed consent,
      risk-benefit analysis, and gene editing implications
    tools:
    - IRB submission system
    - Ethics review frameworks
    duration: 3 weeks
    outputs:
    - Ethics committee approval
    - Informed consent templates
    decision_points:
    - Ethical acceptability of germline editing
    - Patient vulnerability assessment
  - step: 4
    actor: Patient Recruitment Team
    action: Execute patient recruitment strategy including screening, informed consent,
      and enrollment procedures
    tools:
    - Patient registry databases
    - Recruitment tracking software
    duration: 8 weeks
    outputs:
    - Enrolled patient cohort
    - Screening failure reports
    decision_points:
    - Recruitment target achievement
    - Patient diversity requirements
  - step: 5
    actor: Clinical Research Coordinator
    action: Conduct trial execution including treatment administration, monitoring,
      and data collection
    tools:
    - Electronic data capture systems
    - Gene sequencing equipment
    duration: 24 weeks
    outputs:
    - Trial data sets
    - Adverse event reports
    decision_points:
    - Safety monitoring triggers
    - Protocol deviation handling
  - step: 6
    actor: Safety Monitoring Board
    action: Review safety data and make recommendations for trial continuation, modification,
      or termination
    tools:
    - Safety database systems
    - Statistical analysis software
    duration: Ongoing bi-weekly reviews
    outputs:
    - Safety recommendations
    - Trial modification protocols
    decision_points:
    - Unacceptable safety signals
    - Efficacy futility analysis
  - step: 7
    actor: Data Manager
    action: Perform data analysis, statistical evaluation, and prepare clinical study
      report
    tools:
    - Statistical software
    - Data visualization tools
    duration: 8 weeks
    outputs:
    - Clinical study report
    - Publication manuscripts
    decision_points:
    - Primary endpoint achievement
    - Subgroup analysis requirements
  success_criteria: Successful demonstration of gene editing safety and efficacy with
    regulatory approval pathway established
  failure_modes:
  - Unexpected adverse events leading to trial halt
  - Regulatory rejection of IND
  - Poor patient recruitment
  - Ethical concerns blocking approval
