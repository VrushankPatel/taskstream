  title: "Crisis Management Cybersecurity Incident Response Workflow"
  department: "IT Security/Crisis Management"
  complexity: "high"
  participants: ["CISO", "Incident Response Team", "IT Operations", "Legal Counsel", "Communications Team", "Business Continuity", "External Forensics"]
  trigger: "Detection of cybersecurity incident with potential business impact"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      actor: "IT Operations"
      action: "Detect and initially assess cybersecurity incident scope and impact"
      tools: ["SIEM systems", "Intrusion detection tools", "Initial assessment frameworks"]
      duration: "30 minutes"
      outputs: ["Initial incident assessment", "Impact analysis", "Containment recommendations"]
    - step: 2
      actor: "CISO"
      action: "Activate incident response team and declare incident severity level"
      tools: ["Incident response protocols", "Severity classification frameworks", "Team activation systems"]
      duration: "1 hour"
      outputs: ["Activated response team", "Severity declaration", "Initial response plan"]
    - step: 3
      actor: "Incident Response Team"
      action: "Contain the incident and prevent further damage or data exfiltration"
      tools: ["Containment tools", "Network isolation systems", "Damage control procedures"]
      duration: "4 hours"
      outputs: ["Containment measures", "Damage assessment", "Isolation verification"]
      decision_points: ["Containment effectiveness", "Business continuity impact"]
    - step: 4
      actor: "External Forensics"
      action: "Conduct forensic analysis to determine attack vector and data compromise scope"
      tools: ["Digital forensics tools", "Malware analysis systems", "Log analysis platforms"]
      duration: "48 hours"
      outputs: ["Forensic analysis report", "Attack vector identification", "Compromise assessment"]
    - step: 5
      actor: "Legal Counsel"
      action: "Assess legal obligations including breach notification and regulatory reporting"
      tools: ["Legal compliance databases", "Breach notification frameworks", "Regulatory requirement systems"]
      duration: "6 hours"
      outputs: ["Legal assessment", "Notification requirements", "Regulatory reporting plan"]
    - step: 6
      actor: "Communications Team"
      action: "Develop stakeholder communication strategy and prepare notifications"
      tools: ["Communication templates", "Stakeholder databases", "Media monitoring tools"]
      duration: "4 hours"
      outputs: ["Communication strategy", "Stakeholder notifications", "Media response protocols"]
    - step: 7
      actor: "Business Continuity"
      action: "Implement recovery procedures and restore affected systems"
      tools: ["Business continuity plans", "System recovery procedures", "Backup restoration tools"]
      duration: "24-72 hours"
      outputs: ["System recovery", "Business continuity measures", "Service restoration verification"]
    - step: 8
      actor: "CISO"
      action: "Conduct post-incident review and implement preventive measures"
      tools: ["Incident review frameworks", "Root cause analysis tools", "Preventive action planning"]
      duration: "1 week"
      outputs: ["Post-incident report", "Preventive measures", "Lessons learned documentation"]
   success_criteria: "Rapid incident containment, minimal business impact, comprehensive recovery, and implemented preventive measures"
   failure_modes: ["Delayed detection causing increased damage", "Ineffective containment allowing further compromise", "Inadequate communication damaging reputation", "Incomplete recovery leading to recurring incidents"]
   metrics:
     - "Incident response time: Target <4 hours"
     - "Data breach impact: Target <1% of systems"
     - "Recovery time: Target <24 hours"
     - "Communication effectiveness: Target 95% stakeholder satisfaction"
     - "Preventive measures implementation: Target 100% completion"
