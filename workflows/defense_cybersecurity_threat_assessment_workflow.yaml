  title: Defense Cybersecurity Threat Assessment Process
  department: Cybersecurity Operations
  complexity: complex
  participants:
  - Cybersecurity Analyst
  - Threat Intelligence Lead
  - Defense Operations Commander
  - Legal Counsel
  - IT Security Team
  trigger: Detection of anomalous network activity or intelligence reports of potential
    cyber threats
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Cybersecurity Analyst
    action: Initial threat detection and alert triage using SIEM systems and threat
      intelligence feeds
    tools:
    - SIEM Platform
    - Threat Intelligence Platforms
    - Network Monitoring Tools
    duration: 30 minutes
    outputs:
    - Initial Threat Report
    - Alert Classification
  - step: 2
    actor: Threat Intelligence Lead
    action: Conduct comprehensive threat intelligence analysis including IOC correlation
      and attribution assessment
    tools:
    - Threat Intelligence Databases
    - Malware Analysis Tools
    - Geopolitical Intelligence Sources
    duration: 4 hours
    outputs:
    - Threat Intelligence Brief
    - Risk Assessment Matrix
  - step: 3
    actor: Defense Operations Commander
    action: Review threat assessment and determine operational impact and response
      requirements
    decision_points:
    - Critical Infrastructure Impact
    - National Security Implications
    - Response Urgency
    duration: 2 hours
    outputs:
    - Operational Impact Assessment
    - Response Authorization
  - step: 4
    actor: Legal Counsel
    action: Assess legal implications and compliance requirements for threat response
      actions
    tools:
    - Legal Databases
    - Regulatory Frameworks
    - International Law References
    duration: 3 hours
    outputs:
    - Legal Compliance Review
    - Authorization Documentation
  - step: 5
    actor: IT Security Team
    action: Implement containment measures and coordinate with external defense agencies
      if required
    tools:
    - Firewall Systems
    - Intrusion Prevention Systems
    - Coordination Platforms
    duration: 6 hours
    outputs:
    - Containment Report
    - Interagency Coordination Log
  success_criteria: Threat successfully contained with minimal operational disruption
    and comprehensive documentation
  failure_modes:
  - Delayed response due to classification delays
  - Insufficient intelligence leading to misattribution
  - Legal constraints preventing effective containment
  metrics:
  - 'Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): < 15 minutes'
  - 'Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): < 2 hours'
  - 'Threat Containment Success Rate: > 95%'
  - 'False Positive Rate: < 5%'
  - 'Interagency Coordination Efficiency: > 90% satisfaction'
