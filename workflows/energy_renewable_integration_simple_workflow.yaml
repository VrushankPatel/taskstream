       duration: "1 day"
        outputs: ["Integration Approval", "Connection Schedule"]
   success_criteria: "Renewable source successfully integrated within 45 days without grid instability and full regulatory compliance"
   failure_modes: ["Technical incompatibility", "Grid capacity exceeded", "Regulatory non-compliance", "Economic unviability", "Permitting delays"]
   metrics:
     - "Integration time: <45 days"
     - "Grid stability: >99.9% uptime"
     - "Renewable capacity utilization: >95%"
     - "Compliance rate: 100%"
     - "Cost efficiency: <10% over budget"
