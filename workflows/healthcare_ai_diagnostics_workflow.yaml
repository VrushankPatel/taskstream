  title: "AI-Assisted Diagnostics Workflow"
  department: "Medical Diagnostics"
  complexity: "high"
  participants: ["Radiologist", "AI Specialist", "Chief of Medicine", "IT Security", "Patient Care Coordinator"]
  trigger: "Patient imaging study uploaded to PACS system"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      actor: "AI System"
      action: "Automatically analyze imaging data using trained models for abnormalities"
      tools: ["PACS", "AI Diagnostic Platform", "Radiology Workstation"]
      duration: "5-15 minutes"
      outputs: ["Preliminary AI findings report", "Confidence scores", "Annotated images"]
    - step: 2
      actor: "Radiologist"
      action: "Review AI findings, validate results, and make final diagnosis"
      decision_points: ["AI confidence threshold met?", "Clinical context alignment", "Need for additional imaging?"]
      duration: "20-45 minutes"
      outputs: ["Final diagnostic report", "Treatment recommendations", "Follow-up requirements"]
    - step: 3
      actor: "Patient Care Coordinator"
      action: "Communicate results to patient and coordinate next steps"
      tools: ["EHR System", "Patient Portal", "Appointment Scheduling"]
      duration: "15-30 minutes"
      outputs: ["Patient notification", "Care plan documentation", "Appointment scheduling"]
    - step: 4
      actor: "AI Specialist"
      action: "Monitor AI performance metrics and update models as needed"
      tools: ["AI Monitoring Dashboard", "Model Training Platform"]
      duration: "Weekly review"
      outputs: ["Performance reports", "Model updates", "Quality improvement recommendations"]
  success_criteria: "Accurate diagnosis delivered within 24 hours, patient satisfaction >95%, AI accuracy >98%"
  failure_modes: ["AI false positive requiring unnecessary procedures", "Delayed diagnosis due to system downtime", "Privacy breach from data handling errors"]
