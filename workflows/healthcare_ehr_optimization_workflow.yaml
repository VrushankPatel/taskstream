   trigger: Performance degradation in EHR system affecting clinical workflows
   temporal_data:
     first_implemented: "2023-02-01"
     last_updated: "2024-10-01"
     typical_cycle_time: "8 weeks"
     average_annual_executions: 2
     seasonal_variations: ["Post-regulatory changes increase frequency", "Maintenance windows during low patient volume"]
     historical_evolution: "Manual optimization processes evolved to automated monitoring and AI-driven recommendations in 2024"
   performance_history:
     success_rate_trend: "80% (2023) → 87% (2024) → 92% (2025)"
     cost_trend: "$300K (2023) → $250K (2024) → $200K (2025)"
     efficiency_improvements: ["Automated monitoring reduced manual audits by 60%", "AI recommendations improved optimization accuracy by 45%", "Phased rollouts minimized clinical disruption by 80%"]
   steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: IT Director
    action: Conduct system performance audit and identify bottlenecks
    tools:
    - EHR monitoring tools
    - Database query analyzers
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Performance audit report
  - step: 2
    actor: Clinical Department Heads
    action: Review audit findings and prioritize optimization opportunities
    decision_points:
    - Clinical impact vs. implementation effort
    - Regulatory compliance requirements
    duration: 3 days
    outputs:
    - Prioritized optimization roadmap
  - step: 3
    actor: EHR Vendor
    action: Provide technical recommendations and system configuration changes
    tools:
    - Vendor support portal
    - Configuration management tools
    duration: 2 weeks
    outputs:
    - Technical implementation plan
  - step: 4
    actor: IT Director
    action: Implement approved optimizations with phased rollout
    tools:
    - Change management system
    - Testing environments
    duration: 4 weeks
    outputs:
    - Optimized EHR system
  - step: 5
    actor: Compliance Officer
    action: Validate HIPAA compliance of all changes
    tools:
    - Compliance checklists
    - Audit logs
    duration: 1 week
    outputs:
    - Compliance certification
  - step: 6
    actor: Chief Medical Information Officer
    action: Monitor post-implementation performance and user adoption
    tools:
    - User feedback surveys
    - Performance dashboards
    duration: Ongoing
    outputs:
    - Performance improvement metrics
  success_criteria: 20% improvement in EHR response times and 95% user satisfaction
  failure_modes:
  - Insufficient stakeholder buy-in
  - Data migration errors
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  metrics:
  - 'EHR response time improvement: Target 20% faster'
  - 'User satisfaction score: Target >4.5/5'
  - 'System uptime: Target >99.9%'
  - 'Data accuracy rate: Target >99%'
  - 'Compliance audit pass rate: Target 100%'
