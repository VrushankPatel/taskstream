  title: EU Climate Risk Assessment for Commercial Properties
  department: Underwriting
  complexity: complex
  participants:
  - Climate Risk Analyst
  - Underwriter
  - Catastrophe Modeler
  - ESG Specialist
  - Regulatory Compliance Officer
  trigger: New commercial property insurance application or policy renewal in high-risk
    climate zones
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2021-01-10'
    last_updated: '2024-09-30'
    typical_cycle_time: 10-15 business days
    average_annual_executions: 3400
    seasonal_variations:
    - Q1 policy renewals peak 45% increase
    - Wildfire season (Jul-Sep) detailed assessments increase 30%
    historical_evolution: Basic flood risk 2021, expanded to all climate perils 2022,
      integrated EU Taxonomy compliance 2023, added AI predictive modeling 2024
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Climate Risk Analyst
    action: Collect and analyze historical climate data and future projections for
      property location
    tools:
    - Climate Data Platform
    - EU Copernicus Database
    - Catastrophe Models
    - Geographic Information System
    duration: 2 days
    outputs:
    - Climate Risk Profile
    - Historical Loss Analysis
    - Future Projection Report
    decision_points:
    - High-risk climate zone identified
    - Historical loss frequency above threshold
    - Future projections indicate increasing risk
  - step: 2
    actor: Catastrophe Modeler
    action: Run comprehensive catastrophe models for multiple climate scenarios
    tools:
    - RMS RiskLink
    - AIR Worldwide Models
    - In-house Climate Models
    - Scenario Generator
    duration: 3 days
    outputs:
    - Loss Frequency Models
    - Severity Distributions
    - Exceedance Probability Curves
    - Scenario Loss Estimates
    decision_points:
    - Model convergence achieved
    - Uncertainty bounds acceptable
    - Extreme scenarios modeled
  - step: 3
    actor: ESG Specialist
    action: Evaluate property's climate resilience and EU Taxonomy alignment
    tools:
    - EU Taxonomy Checker
    - Green Building Database
    - Resilience Assessment Framework
    - ESG Scoring Platform
    duration: 1.5 days
    outputs:
    - ESG Risk Score
    - Taxonomy Compliance Report
    - Resilience Recommendations
    - Sustainability Assessment
    decision_points:
    - EU Taxonomy objectives met
    - Climate adaptation measures present
    - Transition risk exposure acceptable
  - step: 4
    actor: Regulatory Compliance Officer
    action: Ensure assessment meets EU regulatory requirements and disclosure standards
    tools:
    - EIOPA Guidelines Database
    - Solvency II Calculator
    - SFDR Compliance Checker
    - Regulatory Update System
    duration: 1 day
    outputs:
    - Compliance Verification
    - Regulatory Filing
    - Disclosure Requirements
    - Capital Adequacy Assessment
    decision_points:
    - EIOPA stress test requirements met
    - SFDR disclosure obligations satisfied
    - Solvency II capital requirements adequate
  - step: 5
    actor: Underwriter
    action: Synthesize all assessments and make underwriting decision with pricing
      recommendations
    tools:
    - Underwriting Workbench
    - Pricing Engine
    - Risk Appetite Framework
    - Decision Support System
    duration: 2 days
    outputs:
    - Underwriting Decision
    - Premium Calculation
    - Terms and Conditions
    - Risk Mitigation Requirements
    decision_points:
    - Risk within appetite
    - Pricing reflects risk level
    - Reinsurance coverage adequate
  success_criteria: Accurate risk assessment completed within 15 days, regulatory
    compliance maintained, profitable pricing achieved
  failure_modes:
  - Inadequate climate data quality
  - Model convergence failures
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  - Underpricing of climate risks
  metrics:
  - 'Assessment completion time: <15 business days (current: 12.5 days)'
  - 'Risk prediction accuracy: >85% (current: 89%)'
  - 'Regulatory compliance rate: >99% (current: 99.7%)'
  - 'Underwriting profitability: >15% ROE (current: 18.2%)'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 78% (2021) → 84% (2023) → 89% (2024)
    cost_trend: €2,450 (2021) → €2,100 (2023) → €1,850 (2024)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - AI climate modeling reduced analysis time by 40%
    - Automated compliance checks saved 1.5 days per assessment
    - Integrated data platforms improved accuracy by 22%
