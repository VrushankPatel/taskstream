  title: Insurance Parametric Risk Modeling Process
  department: Underwriting
  complexity: medium
  participants:
  - Risk Modeler
  - Data Scientist
  - Underwriting Manager
  - Actuary
  trigger: New parametric product development or annual model validation requirement
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Data Scientist
    action: Collect and validate historical data for risk parameters (weather, economic
      indicators, etc.)
    tools:
    - Data Lake Platform
    - ETL Tools
    - Data Quality Software
    duration: 8 hours
    outputs:
    - Validated dataset
    - Data quality report
  - step: 2
    actor: Risk Modeler
    action: Develop parametric triggers and payout structures using statistical modeling
    tools:
    - Statistical Software (R/Python)
    - Risk Modeling Platform
    - Simulation Tools
    duration: 16 hours
    outputs:
    - Parametric model framework
    - Trigger sensitivity analysis
  - step: 3
    actor: Actuary
    action: Validate model assumptions, pricing, and capital requirements
    tools:
    - Actuarial Software
    - Capital Modeling Tools
    - Regulatory Compliance Framework
    duration: 12 hours
    outputs:
    - Pricing validation report
    - Capital adequacy assessment
  - step: 4
    actor: Underwriting Manager
    action: Review model for business viability and risk appetite alignment
    tools:
    - Business Case Template
    - Risk Appetite Framework
    duration: 4 hours
    outputs:
    - Business case approval
    - Implementation roadmap
  success_criteria: Model accuracy within 10% of actual outcomes, pricing competitive,
    regulatory approval obtained within 6 months
  failure_modes:
  - Insufficient historical data
  - Model overfitting
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  - Pricing misalignment
  metrics:
  - 'Model Prediction Accuracy: Target within 10% of actual outcomes'
  - 'Development Timeline: Target <6 months'
  - 'Pricing Competitiveness: Target within 5% of market rates'
  - 'Regulatory Approval Rate: Target >95%'
