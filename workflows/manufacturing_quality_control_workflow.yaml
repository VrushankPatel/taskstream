  title: "Automated Quality Control Workflow"
  department: "Quality Assurance"
  complexity: "medium"
  participants: ["Quality Inspector", "Production Manager", "Maintenance Technician", "Supplier Quality Manager"]
  trigger: "Product batch completes manufacturing line"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      actor: "Automated Inspection System"
      action: "Perform dimensional, visual, and functional testing using sensors and cameras"
      tools: ["Vision Systems", "Coordinate Measuring Machines", "Automated Test Stations"]
      duration: "10-30 minutes per batch"
      outputs: ["Quality metrics data", "Defect classification", "Pass/fail determination"]
    - step: 2
      actor: "Quality Inspector"
      action: "Review automated results and perform manual spot checks"
      decision_points: ["Automated results acceptable?", "Statistical process control within limits?", "Escalation required?"]
      duration: "15-45 minutes"
      outputs: ["Quality approval certificate", "Defect analysis report", "Process adjustment recommendations"]
    - step: 3
      actor: "Production Manager"
      action: "Review quality data and implement process improvements"
      tools: ["Quality Management System", "Statistical Analysis Software"]
      duration: "Daily review"
      outputs: ["Process improvement actions", "Supplier feedback", "Quality trend reports"]
    - step: 4
