  success_criteria: FDA approval achieved with positive Phase 3 results and commercial
    viability confirmed
  failure_modes:
  - Safety concerns in clinical trials
  - Regulatory rejection
  - Manufacturing scalability issues
  - Market competition rendering drug obsolete
  metrics:
  - 'Development success rate: 12% target (industry average)'
  - 'Time to approval: <10 years'
  - 'Development cost: <$2.5B'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 8% (2020) → 10% (2023) → 12% (2025)
    cost_trend: $2.8B (2020) → $2.6B (2023) → $2.4B (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
