    typical_cycle_time: 4 hours per audit
    average_annual_executions: 12
    seasonal_variations:
    - Q4 peak inventory checks
    - Q1 post-holiday reconciliation
    historical_evolution: Process digitized in 2022, reducing audit time by 60% through

    outputs:
    - Preliminary inventory count
    - Discrepancy log
  - step: 2
    actor: Store Manager
    action: Review preliminary counts and reconcile discrepancies with system records
    tools:
    - ERP system
    - Variance analysis reports
    duration: 1 hour
    decision_points:
