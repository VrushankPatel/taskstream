    typical_cycle_time: "2-3 hours daily"
    average_annual_executions: 365
    seasonal_variations: ["Q4 holiday season 50% higher volume", "Back-to-school August peak"]
    historical_evolution: "Manual counting evolved to barcode scanning 2020, automated alerts added 2022"
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Inventory Clerk
    action: Check current inventory levels for all products using automated systems
    tools: ["Inventory Management System", "Barcode Scanner", "Stock Level Dashboard"]
    duration: 30 minutes
    outputs: ["Daily Inventory Report", "Stock Level Analysis"]
    decision_points: ["Minimum stock thresholds reached", "Fast-moving items identified"]
  - step: 2
    actor: Inventory Clerk
    action: Identify items below minimum stock levels and analyze demand patterns
    tools: ["Inventory Database", "Sales Analytics", "Forecasting Tool"]
    duration: 15 minutes
    outputs: ["Reorder List", "Priority Classification", "Demand Forecast"]
    decision_points: ["Urgent vs standard reorder", "Seasonal demand consideration"]
  - step: 3
    actor: Store Manager
    action: Approve reorder quantities and place orders with preferred suppliers
    tools: ["Supplier Portal", "Purchase Order System", "Budget Approval Tool"]
