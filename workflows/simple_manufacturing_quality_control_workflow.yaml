  title: Simple Manufacturing Quality Control Process
  department: Quality Assurance
  complexity: simple
  participants:
  - Quality Inspector
  - Production Supervisor
  - Line Operator
  trigger: Scheduled quality checks during production runs
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2020-01-01'
    last_updated: '2025-06-01'
    typical_cycle_time: 15-30 minutes
    average_annual_executions: 520
    seasonal_variations:
    - Consistent throughout year
    - Slightly higher during Q4 peak production
    historical_evolution: Standardized from manual checklists to digital tracking,
      reducing inspection time by 40% since 2020
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Quality Inspector
    action: Conduct visual and dimensional inspection of finished products
    tools:
    - Inspection checklist
    - Calipers
    - Go/no-go gauges
    duration: 10 minutes
    outputs:
    - Inspection results
    - Defect documentation
  - step: 2
    actor: Quality Inspector
    action: Record inspection data and determine product acceptability
    tools:
    - Quality management system
    - Digital inspection forms
    duration: 5 minutes
    outputs:
    - Quality records
    - Pass/fail determination
  - step: 3
    actor: Production Supervisor
    action: Review failed inspections and initiate corrective actions
    tools:
    - Quality dashboard
    - Corrective action log
    duration: 10 minutes
    outputs:
    - Corrective action plan
    - Production adjustments
  success_criteria: 100% of products inspected meet quality specifications
  failure_modes:
  - Measurement errors
  - Inconsistent inspection standards
  - Delayed corrective actions
  metrics:
  - 'First pass yield: 95% target'
  - 'Defect rate: <2% target'
  - 'Inspection compliance: 100% target'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 92% (2023) → 95% (2024) → 97% (2025)
    cost_trend: $0.45/unit (2023) → $0.38/unit (2024) → $0.32/unit (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - Digital checklists reduced paperwork by 60%
    - Automated data entry improved accuracy by 25%
