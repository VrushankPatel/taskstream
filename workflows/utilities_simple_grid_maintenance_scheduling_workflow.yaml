  title: Electrical Grid Maintenance Scheduling Process
  department: Grid Operations
  complexity: simple
  participants:
  - Maintenance Scheduler
  - Field Technician
  - Operations Supervisor
  trigger: Scheduled preventive maintenance or system alert
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2018-07-01'
    last_updated: '2024-08-20'
    typical_cycle_time: 1-2 weeks
    average_annual_executions: 5000
    seasonal_variations:
    - Spring/summer peak for vegetation management
    - Winter focus on equipment reliability
    historical_evolution: IoT sensors in 2021 enabled predictive maintenance, reducing
      unplanned outages by 45%
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Maintenance Scheduler
    action: Review maintenance schedule and system alerts
    tools:
    - Asset management system
    - IoT monitoring dashboard
    duration: 30 minutes
    outputs:
    - Maintenance work order
    - Resource allocation plan
  - step: 2
    actor: Operations Supervisor
    action: Approve maintenance schedule and coordinate resources
    tools:
    - Work management system
    duration: 15 minutes
    outputs:
    - Approved work order
    - Safety briefing requirements
  - step: 3
    actor: Field Technician
    action: Execute maintenance and document completion
    tools:
    - Mobile work order app
