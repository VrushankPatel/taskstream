    seasonal_variations: ["Summer peak usage readings", "Winter lower readings"]
    historical_evolution: "Manual reading transitioned to AMI in 2020, added mobile app verification in 2023"
   steps:
     - step: 1
       actor: "Meter Reader"
       action: "Access meter location and record reading"
       tools: ["Mobile reading device", "GPS navigation", "Access keys/codes database"]
       duration: "5 minutes"
       decision_points: ["Meter accessibility confirmed", "Reading device functionality", "Safety conditions acceptable", "Customer contact required"]
       outputs: ["Meter reading data", "Location verification", "Access notes", "Safety observations"]
     - step: 2
       actor: "Meter Reader"
       action: "Verify reading accuracy and note any issues"
       tools: ["Reading validation software", "Historical data comparison"]
       duration: "2 minutes"
       decision_points: ["Reading within expected range", "Equipment tampering indicators", "Maintenance issues detected", "Re-reading required"]
       outputs: ["Validated reading", "Maintenance flags if needed", "Anomaly report", "Photo documentation if required"]
     - step: 3
       actor: "Field Supervisor"
       action: "Review readings for anomalies and dispatch maintenance"
       decision_points: ["Reading variance exceeds threshold", "Equipment condition requires service", "Pattern of anomalies detected", "Emergency maintenance needed"]
       duration: "10 minutes"
       tools: ["Anomaly detection system", "Maintenance scheduling platform"]
       outputs: ["Approved readings", "Maintenance work orders", "Priority assignments", "Follow-up scheduling"]
  success_criteria: "All meters read within billing cycle with >99% accuracy"
