  title: Power Outage Response and Restoration Process
  department: Grid Operations
  complexity: simple
  participants:
  - Control Room Operator
  - Field Technician
  - Outage Coordinator
  trigger: Customer reports power outage or monitoring system detects interruption
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2017-01-01'
    last_updated: '2024-07-01'
    typical_cycle_time: 1-4 hours
    average_annual_executions: 12500
    seasonal_variations:
    - Q1 peak for winter storms
    - Q3 peak for summer heat waves
    historical_evolution: Added predictive analytics in 2022, drone inspection capability
      in 2024
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Control Room Operator
    action: Verify outage through SCADA system and customer reports, isolate affected
      area
    tools:
    - SCADA System
    - Outage Management System
    duration: 5-15 minutes
    outputs:
    - Outage confirmation
    - Affected customer count
    decision_points:
    - Outage confirmed? (Yes/No)
    - Safety hazards present? (Yes/No)
    - Critical infrastructure affected? (Yes/No)
  - step: 2
    actor: Outage Coordinator
    action: Assess outage cause, prioritize restoration based on critical infrastructure
      impact
    tools:
    - GIS Mapping
    - Priority Matrix
    duration: 15-30 minutes
    outputs:
    - Restoration plan
    - Resource allocation
    decision_points:
    - Cause identified? (Yes/No)
    - Parts required? (Yes/No)
    - Multiple crews needed? (Yes/No)
  - step: 3
    actor: Field Technician
    action: Deploy to site, diagnose issue, and perform repairs
    tools:
    - Diagnostic Equipment
    - Repair Tools
    - Safety Gear
    duration: 30-180 minutes
    outputs:
    - Repair completion
    - System restoration
    decision_points:
    - Issue diagnosed? (Yes/No)
    - Repair possible on-site? (Yes/No)
    - Power safely restored? (Yes/No)
  success_criteria: Power restored within 4 hours for 95% of outages with safety protocols
    followed
  failure_modes:
  - Equipment failure requiring parts
  - Safety hazards delaying access
  - Multiple simultaneous outages
  metrics:
  - 'Average Restoration Time: 2.5 hours target'
  - 'Customer Satisfaction: 90% target'
  - 'Safety Incident Rate: 0% target'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 88% (2023) → 92% (2024) → 94% (2025)
    cost_trend: $125 (2023) → $115 (2024) → $105 (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - Predictive maintenance reduced outages by 15%
    - Mobile workforce management decreased response time by 25%
