  title: Utilities Smart Grid Cybersecurity Monitoring and Response
  department: Cybersecurity
  complexity: medium
  participants:
  - Cybersecurity Analyst
  - Grid Operations Manager
  - IT Security Team
  - Regulatory Compliance
  trigger: Security alert or scheduled assessment
  temporal_data:
    first_implemented: '2023-06-01'
    last_updated: '2024-09-01'
    typical_cycle_time: 24 hours for incidents, weekly for monitoring
    average_annual_executions: 200
    seasonal_variations:
    - Holiday period increased threats
    - Maintenance windows for updates
    historical_evolution: Basic firewall protection evolved to AI-driven threat detection
      in 2024, now includes automated response
  steps:
  - step: 1
    actor: Cybersecurity Analyst
    action: Monitor grid systems for security threats
    tools:
    - SIEM systems

    - Incident documentation
    duration: 4 hours
    outputs:
    - Incident report
    - Regulatory filings
  success_criteria: Threat contained within 2 hours with no grid disruption
  failure_modes:
  - False positives
  - Advanced persistent threats
  - System complexity
  metrics:
  - 'Response time: <2 hours target'
  - 'False positive rate: <5%'
  - 'System availability: 99.99%'
  performance_history:
    success_rate_trend: 85% (2023) → 92% (2024) → 95% (2025)
    cost_trend: $300K (2023) → $280K (2024) → $260K (2025)
    efficiency_improvements:
    - AI detection reduced response time by 45%
    - Automated response decreased manual intervention by 60%
